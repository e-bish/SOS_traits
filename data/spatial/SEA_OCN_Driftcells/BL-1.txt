Blakely Island quad

This cell has its origin 1.4 km southeast of the northernmost extent of Blakely Island. 
 
Net shore-drift is to the northwest along Rosario Strait for 1.2 km where sediment is 

deposited at a wide gravel beach. The cell originates immediately northwest of a
 
slight change in orientation of the coastline, southeast of which there is not a wave-cut
 
platform wide enough for a beach to accumulate upon.  The shore along the beginning
 
of this cell consists of Paleozoic-aged greenstone that contains many joints, causing

numerous rockslides that yield a small amount of drift sediment. The greenstone is
 
overlain by sandy glacial drift at several locations, providing the primary sediment source

within this cell.  The first 1 km of this cell contains many small, rocky prominences
 
impinging on the beach that cause sediment to accumulate on the southeast side,

evidencing northwestward net shore-drift.  Sediment size decreases and beach width

increases to the northwest, locally, between these rock prominences, further indicating
 
northwestward net shore-drift.  Net shore-drift material is deposited on a pebble and
 
cobble beach that fronts a low-elevation, glacial drift deposit that is exposed in a

0.5-m-high scarp directly behind the beach.  No appreciable net shore-drift occurs from
 
the origin of this cell southeast for 4 km to the southeast-facing shore of Blakely Island.

Very little coastal sediment is found within this stretch of rocky shore, occurring only in
 
isolated accumulations.
