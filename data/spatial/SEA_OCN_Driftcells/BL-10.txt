Blakely Island quad

This drift cell has generally eastward net shore-drift that originates at the zone of drift divergence
 
separating this cell from the cell to the south.  The bluff along this cell changes from erosional and
 
near-vertical, to stable and well-vegetated, moving from west to east, indicating net shore-drift in that
 
direction.  Drift material is transported for 0.7 km along Peavine Pass to a relatively wide pebble beach
 
that is accumulating against a rip-rap groin on the western side of a marina, indicating eastward net
 
shore-drift.  Other drift indicators in this cell are increasing beach width and decreasing sediment size to
 
the east.
