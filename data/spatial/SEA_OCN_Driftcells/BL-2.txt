Blakely Island quad

This 0.6-km-long drift cell has its origin at a zone of drift divergence west of Black Rock with
 net shore-drift to the northeast along a fairly linear beach.  A minimal volume of sediment is

derived from cliff erosion and is transported by southerly winds in Rosario Strait in this cell.
 
Net shore-drift indicators include a marked decrease in sediment size, increased beach width,
 
and accumulation of sediment on the southwest side of the rock prominence delineating the
 
terminus of the cell.
