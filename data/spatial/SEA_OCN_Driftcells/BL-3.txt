Blakely Island quad

This cell has its origin at a zone of drift divergence in common with the cell to

 the immediate north.  Net shore-drift is to the southwest along a linear beach, 

terminating at a sandy section of beach abutting a rocky headland.  The sediment 

sources in this cell are eroding cliffs and small glacial drift deposits.  Beach width
 
increases, and mean sediment size decreases to the southwest, indicating net 

shore-drift in that direction.  The accumulation of sediment against the northeast side
 
of the rocky headland at the cell's terminus further evidences southwestward net 

shore-drift.  No appreciable net shore-drift occurs from the terminus of this cell until 

the southernmost portion of the island.  Three large pocket beaches are present
 
within this sector.
