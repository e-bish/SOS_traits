Blakely Island quad

This 0.5 km drift cell has westward net shore-drift that deposits at

 the southernmost tip of Blakely Island.  Sediment is derived from
 
glacial outwash and till, that intermittently overly greenstone, and 

from an eroding cliff consisting of greenstone at the origin of the cell.
 
The volume of drift sediment is minimal in this cell, since a considerable
 
amount of material is lost to the deeper water of Thatcher Pass, where
 
strong tidal currents occur.  Westward net shore-drift is evidenced by a
 
westward decrease in sediment size from boulders and cobbles at the
 
origin to mixed gravel and sand at the cell's terminus, and by increased
 
beach width to the west.  The terminus is located at an unnamed point
 
at the southern tip of the island.
