Blakely Island quad

Net shore-drift in this drift cell is to the south along a 1.0 km coastal sector 

located southeast of Willow Island that extends to the southern tip of Blakely 

Island.  The origin of the cell has near-vertical cliffs of greenstone with glacial

till deposits adjacent to the south.  Till provides the bulk of the drift sediment in
 
this cell, evident in a short sand and pebble beach located 200 m south of the

cell's origin. The beach is accumulating against a large rocky prominence to the
 
south, and shows beach width increase and sediment size decrease in the same
 
direction, indicating net shore-drift to the south.  Southward net shore-drift continues
 
beyond this prominence along a narrow beach that fronts a seacliff.  The beach
 
gradually becomes wider and again shows a decrease in sediment size until the
 
cell's terminus at the southern tip of Blakely Island.
