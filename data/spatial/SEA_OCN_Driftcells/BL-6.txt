Blakely Island quad

This drift cell is located within the embayment that contains the settlement of Thatcher. 
 
The cell has its origin on the northeast side of a stream outlet that transports drift sediment 

to the shore.  Beach width increases and mean sediment size decreases to the northeast, 

indicating net shore-drift in that direction.  Net shore-drift is northeastward for 0.5 km to the
 
base of a rocky prominence in the center of the bay head, where a small stream delta is

also present.
