Blakely Island quad

This cell originates near Bald Bluff and has net shore-drift for 0.7 km
 
into the head of the bay that contains the settlement of Thatcher.  

Drift material is derived from small deposits of glacial till located on
 
the southern side of Bald Bluff, at the origin of the cell.  Northeastward
 
net shore-drift is indicated by an increase in beach width, from a very 

narrow beach near the origin of the cell to a beach of moderate width in
 
front of Thatcher, and by the presence of sediment accumulations on the
 
southwest side of rocks partially interrupting sediment transport. Beach sediment
 
consists of boulders and finer gravel near the beginning of the cell, which grade

 into pebbles and sand by the cell's terminus, further indicating northeastward 

net shore-drift.
