Blakely Island quad

This 1.6-km-long cell originates at a zone of drift divergence at Bald Bluff. 
 Net shore-drift is to the north to a cuspate spit located south of the Blakely 
Island landing strip.  The source of sediment in this cell is erosion of Bald 
Bluff and a thin lens of glacial till that is found intermittently near the cell's 
origin.  Northward net shore-drift is indicated by northward beach width 
increase and sediment size decrease, sediment accumulation on the south
 side of an artificial rock groin half way along the cell, and the progradation 
of a small cuspate spit that contains ponded water at the cell's terminus.
