Blakely Island quad

This drift cell originates at an erosional prominence and has generally southwestward net shore-drift along a sinuous shore for 1.5 km.   An erosional zone is located at the origin of the cell along northwestern Blakely Island with overhanging trees and a low-elevation, near-vertical bluff cut into glacial till. Southwestward and southward net shore-drift is indicated by increased bluff vegetation and beach width increase, and decreased sediment size to the southwest, and progradation of a small cuspate spit at the cell's terminus.  Some deposition of drift material occurs at a small point west of the landing strip, as evidenced by a relatively wide, sandy beach, due to secondarry northward shore drift during times of southerly winds.  The fetch from the northwest at this coastal sector, with exposure to winds from East Sound (Eastsound quadrangle), is responsible for the dominent, generally southwestward net shore-drift.
