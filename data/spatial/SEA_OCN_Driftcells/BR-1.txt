Friday Harbor quad

This cell, the only net shore-drift cell on Brown Island, is located on the 
southwest shore of the island.  Net shore-drift originates on the 
western side of the base of an unnamed point extending from the 
island's southeast corner.  Net shore-drift is northwestward for 0.5 km.
 Drift sediment is derived from glacial till, which is found along the shore 
of central Brown Island, between outcrops of siltstone located at the
 southeast and northwest ends of the island. Northwestward net 
shore-drift is indicated by local beach width increase and 
sediment size decrease to the northwest, sediment accumulations on the southeast side of rocks partially interrupting drift, and by the presence 
of nearshore bars oriented east-west, moving to the northwest.  The terminus of this cell is found abutting a relatively large rock prominence at the southwest 
corner of the island.
