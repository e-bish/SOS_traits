(Quillayute Prairie, La Push quads)

This cell includes the origin and southern portion of a drift cell
terminat-ing at the northern extent of Second Beach.  Net shore-drift
to the north is indicated by an accumulation of
heavy driftwood and an increase in beach width to the north. Bluff
morphology also indicates the direction of net shore-drift in the
following manner.  At the origin of this drift cell the bluff is at its
steepest with little to no vegetation.  Progressing northward, toward
the terminus of this drift cell, the bluff becomes less steep and more
heavily vegetated.
