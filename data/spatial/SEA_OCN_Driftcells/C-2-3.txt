(La Push quad)
Originating in a zone of divergence centered about 1 kilometer south of
Ellen Creek, this drift cell ends at the point of a spit built across
the mouth of the Quillayute River.  Southward net shore-drift is
indicated by a progradation of this spit and a decrease in sediment
size to the south.
