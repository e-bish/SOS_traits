(La Push quad)
Beginning at a zone of drift divergence due east of Jagged Island, this
short drift cell terminates at a headland approximately 0.5 kilometer
to the south.  A southerly net shore-drift direction is indicated by an
increase in beach width and an accumula-tion of heavy driftwood to the
south.  This drift reversal is in part due to wave refraction generated
by several offshore islands.
