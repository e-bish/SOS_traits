(Allens Bay quad)
This drift cell begins along the north side of an upland north of
Kayostla Beach and terminates at the northern end of Yellow Banks.  A
narrow, coarse grained beach extends for approximately 3 kilometers
north to the point of origin where it widens to form the sandy beach at
Yellow Banks.  Net shore-drift to the north is indicated by a decrease
in sediment size and an increase in beach width to the north.
