(Allens Bay and Ozette quads)
This drift cell originates along the north side of a
 headland north of Yellow Ranks.  Net shore-drift to the north is
 indicated by increasing beach width, decreasing sediment
 size, and decreasing bluff slope in a northerly direction.  This
 drift cell ends at Sand Point where a wide, fine--grained sand beach exists.
