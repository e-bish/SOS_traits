(Ozette quad)
Originating at a zone of drift divergence centered about 1 kilometer
north of Sand Point, this drift cell has a southerly net shore-drift.
This drift direction is indicated by an increase in beach width and a
decrease in sediment size to the south.  This drift cell terminates
along the north side of Sand Point.
