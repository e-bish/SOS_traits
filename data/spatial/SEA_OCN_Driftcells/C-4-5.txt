(Ozette quad)
This short drift cell originates in a zone of divergence approximately
0.5 kilometer  north of Tskawahyah Island and ends along the north side
of the Tskawahyah Island tombolo.  Net shore-drift to the south is
indicated by increasing beach width, decreasing bluff slope, and an
overall decrease in sediment size to the south.  This drift reversal is
in part related to wave refraction around offshore islands, resulting
in a southerly wave approach.
