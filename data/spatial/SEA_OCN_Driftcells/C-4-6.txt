(Ozette quad)
Beginning at a zone of divergence located about 0.5 kilometer north of
Tskawahyah Island and terminating at a headland immediately south of
the Ozette River, this drift cell displays a northward net
shore-drift.  This drift direction is indicated by an increase in beach
width and a decrease in bluff slope to the north.
