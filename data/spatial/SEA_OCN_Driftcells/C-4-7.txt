(Ozette quad)
This drift cell originates at the mouth of the Ozette River and ends at
the onset of a series of rocky headlands due east of the stacks named
Father and Son.  Northward net shore-drift is indicated by an increase
in beach width north of the Ozette River, and the northward deflection
of a small stream.  The area from the rocky headlands east of the
stacks named Father and Son to the Point of the Arches is characterized
by no appreciable net shore-drift.  Deep water lies directly offshore
of the nearly vertical cliffs present within this area.
