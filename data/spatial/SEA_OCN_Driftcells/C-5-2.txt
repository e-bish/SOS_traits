(Makah Bay quad)
This drift cell begins at a zone of divergence centered near Petroleum
Creek and ends at a headland north of Shi Shi Beach.  A northerly net
shore-drift direction is indicated by an increase in sediment volume
and a decrease in bluff slope to the north.  The coastline from the
rocky headlands immediately south of Portage Head to the second small
headland north of Anderson Point is characterized by no appreciable net
shore-drift due to the presence of deep water directly offshore.
