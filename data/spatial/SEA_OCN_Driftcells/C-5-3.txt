(Makah Bay quad)
Originating along the north side of the second small headland north of
Anderson Point, this drift cell terminates at the east side of Waatch
Point.  Net shore-drift to the north is indicated by the significant
northward deflection of the Sooes and Waatch Rivers.  Hobuck Beach has
prograded northward causing a 0.5 kilometer deflection of the Waatch
River.  The coastal stretch from the west side of Waatch Point to the
northwest corner of Cape Flattery is characterized by no appreciable
net shore-drift.  Directly offshore of these prominent headlands deep
water impedes shore drift.  The northwest side of Cape Flattery is
characterized by no appreciable net shore-drift due to deep water which
impedes shore drift.
