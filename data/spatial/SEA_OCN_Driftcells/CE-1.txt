Lopez Pass quad

This cell is the only net shore-drift cell on rocky Center Island, located on the
 southeast shore of the island.  Net shore-drift originates 300 m northeast of the 
southern tip of the island at an unvegetated, eroding bluff composed of glacial drift,
 the only substantial glacial deposit that occur along the shore of Center 
Island.  Net shore-drift is northeastward, as indicated by a well-vegetated bluff
and decreasing sediment size to the northeast, and progradation of a 
short tombolo at the cell's terminus, located at the eastern tip of the island. 
 Beach width increases in the direction of net shore drift over the first 0.6 km of 
the 1.1 km cell, after which it decreases due to the convex nature of the shore
 and the fact that there has been no additional sediment input other than at the
 origin of the cell.
