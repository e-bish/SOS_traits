Cape Disappointment quad

This drift cell originates on the east side of Jetty A, has eastward, then 
northerly net shore-drift, and terminates to the southeast of the Coast Guard 
Motor Lifeboat School. Jetty A extends to the south from a basaltic headland 
for approximately 1.2 km. It is composed of large rip-rap.

Slight erosion of the bank near Jetty A provides some of the sediment, but the 
majority is probably derived from waves which drive sediment back into the 
mouth of the Columbia River.

Beach width increases gradually to the east with concentric beach ridges 
evident midway through the cell. Cobbles of various composition have been 
eroded from Jetty A and transported to the east. This results in a 
particle size decrease to the east. However, the majority of sediment within 
this cell consists of sand-sized grains. The terminus for this drift cell is in a 
small bay where sediment is accumulating and gradually filling in the bay. 
Sediment transport within this cell is a result of the large easterly fetch across 
the open ocean.
