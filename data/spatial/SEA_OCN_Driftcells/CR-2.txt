Cape Disappointment quad

Slight erosion of the bank indicates the origin of this northtrending drift cell 
which terminates at the Coast Guard Motor Lifeboat School bulkhead. Beach 
width increases to the north in this short drift cell. A lobe of sediment 
prograding to the north over the rip-rap of the bulkhead indicates the terminus 
of this drift cell. Sand-sized sediment prevails along this entire drift cell. A local 

southeasterly fetch drives sediment transport within this cell.
