Cape Disappointment, Chinook quads

The shore from the Coast Guard Motor Lifeboat School to the northwest edge
 of the Chinook marina exhibits no appreciable net shoredrift. This is a result of
 extensive marshy vegetation and tidal flats.


The shoreline has been modified in a number of areas:

A rip-rap bulkhead begins on the south side of the Coast Guard Motor Lifeboat 
School and protects most of the small bay in which the Coast Guard facilities 
are located. Vegetation has overgrown the rip-rap in this area so
 that it is not readily apparent. It extends for about .8 km to the north.

A boat launch facility to the north of the Coast Guard facilities is built out over 
the marshy foreshore area. The parking lot area is protected by rip-rap while a 
short piling jetty extends to the south. The area covered by these structures is 
about .2 km in length.

The Port of Ilwaco boat basin is sheltered by two riprap jetties and a
 breakwater. This structure extends along the shore for roughly .8 km.

The road in front of the Port of Ilwaco Airport is reinforced with overgrown 
rip-rap for almost 3 km to Stringtown .

Approximately 1.0 km of the shore northwest of Chinook is intermittently
 reinforced by rip-rap and a seawall constructed of logs.


The Port of Chinook marina breakwater consists of rip-rap and parallels the 
shore for roughly .5 km.
