Chinook quad

Beginning to the southeast of the Port of Chinook marina breakwater, this cell 
has southeastward net shore-drift and terminates to the northwest of the
 Chinook county park. Recent dredgings from the boat basin channel have been
 deposited on the backshore at the origin of this drift cell. Grain size
 decrease to the southeast and a slight beach width increase to the southeast
 indicate southeastward net shore-drift. A wooden walkway perpendicular to
 the shore acts as a barrier to shore-drift with accumulation occurring on the 
northwest side and corresponding erosion on the southeast side. A vertical
 offset, approximately 25 cm higher on the northwest than on the southeast 
indicates southeastward transport of sediment. The terminus of this drift cell is
 located to the northwest of the county park. Sediment transport is likely
 related to easterly open-ocean fetch. A local fetch from the northwest probably
 influences this cell as well.



The marina breakwater consists of rip-rap and parallels the shore for roughly .5
 km. The backshore of this drift cell is protected beginning about 45 m to the
 southeast of the Chinook marina and extending  to the northeastern side 
of Chinook Point. The material is predominantly rip-rap but also includes some
 concrete blocks, dead brush, and old machinery parts.
