Chinook, Warrenton, Astoria, Knappton quads

An area of no appreciable net shore-drift occurs from the southeastern edge of
 Chinook to Grays Point. The shore here is characterized mainly by tidal 
flats with small intermittent pockets of vegetation until the northwestern side of 
Chinook Point. Rip-rap extends from the southeastern side of Chinook Point, 
which is bedrock, to Knappton. Along the majority of this distance, the highway 
closely parallels the shore. A few small rocky headlands interrupt this nearly
 continuous stretch of rip-rap. However, roughly 1.25 km to the northeast of Cliff
 Point, the road diverges briefly from the shore. The rip-rap in this particular
 area is less prevalent and is slightly overgrown since the road does not need 
protecting. From Knappton to Grays Point extensive vegetation and tidal flats
 prevent shore-drift.
