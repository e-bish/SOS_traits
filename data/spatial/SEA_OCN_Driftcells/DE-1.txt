Blakely Island quad

This cell originates 0.6 km southwest of Fauntleroy Point, at the beginning of 
the beach within the embayment enclosed by Decatur Head. The sediment 
source for this cell is glacial till, which occurs in a bluff at the origin of the cell.
  Net shore-drift is to the south and southeast for 2 km, depositing at a 
tombolo connecting Decatur Head to Decatur Island.  Generally southeastward 
net shore-drift is indicated by sediment accumulations on the north side of rocks
 partially interrupting drift in the first 0.5 km of the cell, increasing beach
 width and decreasing sediment size to the southeast, and progradation
 of a tombolo at the terminus of the cell.
