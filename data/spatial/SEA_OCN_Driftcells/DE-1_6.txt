Blakely Island quad

The knob that is westernmost Decatur Island is comprised of sedimentary rock 
that is resistent to erosion, with no glacial deposits overlying it, hence, 
the area is devoid of beaches.  No appreciable net shore-drift occurs at this 
knob, including inside Sylvan Bay (Sylvan Cove), where a pocket beach is 
found.  No appreciable net shore-drift occurs along Thatcher Pass, along the
 north end of Decatur Island.
