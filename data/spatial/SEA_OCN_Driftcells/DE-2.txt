Lopez Pass, Blakely Island quads

At 2.5 km in length, this is the longest drift cell along Decatur Island.  The cell 
originates at a zone of drift divergence along White Cliff, a 30- to 
40-m-high, eroding bluff comprised of glacial till (Lopez Pass quadrangle).  
Several bluff failures have occurred recently along this shore, providing 
additional sediment to the shore drift system.  Net shore-drift is to the northeast
 extending around Decatur Head and depositing in a spit prograding 
southwestward on the west side of Decatur Head (Blakely Island quadrangle).  A 
narrow beach fronts White Cliff, consisting of pebbles, cobbles and boulders.
  Lag deposits consisting of boulders up to 2 m in diameter are present in the
 nearshore area here.  Sediment size decreases and beach width increases to
 the northeast to the tombolo that has prograded to Decatur Head, indicating 
northeastward net shore-drift.  As net shore-drift continues to the north around
 rocky Decatur Head the beach becomes temporarily narrower.  This is because
 of increased wave attack and tidal current velocity here, as well as a 
lack of additional sediment input.  As net shore-drift material transits 
counter-clockwise around Decatur Head, it accumulates along the beach on the
 northwest and west side of Decatur Head, and in the spit that extends to
 the southwest from Decatur Head.  This prograding spit constitutes the terminus
 of the drift cell.
