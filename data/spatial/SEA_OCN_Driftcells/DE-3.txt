Lopez Pass quad

This cell originates at a zone of drift divergence at White Cliff.  Net shore-drift is 
to the southwest for 2.0 km to the southwest end of a low elevation tombolo 
near the southern end of Decatur Island.  A narrow cobble and boulder beach is 
present in front of White Cliff, which becomes wider and consists of finer
 sediment towards the southwest, indicating net shore-drift in that direction.  Drift
 material accumulates against a rocky prominence at the southwest end of 
the beach, which is the terminus of the cell.  No appreciable net shore-drift 
occurs south and southwest of the terminus of this cell on southernmost Decatur
 Island.  Several small pocket beaches are present on opposite sides 
of a short tombolo that connects two rocky features.
