Lopez Pass quad

This cell is in southern Reads Bay and has northeastward net shore-drift.  Net 
shore-drift originates at a north-facing bluff comprised of glacial till, the
 sediment source for this cell.  Net shore-drift passes along a concave beach for
 approximately 400 m.  The beach becomes wider and consists of progressively
 finer sediment to the northeast, indicating net shore-drift to the northeast.  The 
terminus of this cell is found at a small accumulation of sediment on the
southwest side of a rocky prominence extending across the beach.
