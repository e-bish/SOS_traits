Blakely Island, Lopez Pass quads

This 2.3 km cell located within Reads Bay exhibits net shore-drift to the
 southeast.  The cell originates east-northeast of Trump Island,where a narrow
 gravel beach fronts an isolated rocky outcrop (Blakely Island quadrangle).  The
 rocky cliff changes to glacial till to the southeast, providing drift material.
  A dock 0.5 km along the cell at the town of Decatur partially blocks 
southeastward net shore-drift, evident in the accumulation on its northwest side.
  Beach width increases and sediment size decreases over the length of 
the cell,further indicating southeastward net shore-drift.  A tide flat is 
present off the beach in southern Reads Bay (Lopez Pass quadrangle).  The
 cell's terminus is found against a rock prominence atthe southern end of the
 beach and adjacent tide flat.
