Blakely Island quad

This is a short (0.7 km) cell found within Brigantine Bay.  Net shore-drift is to the
 northwest.  The origin of the cell is found at a zone of drift divergence
 located east-northeast of Trump Island.  An erosional bluff comprised of glacial
 till is present at the cell origin, fronted by a coarse gravel beach.
  Moving north and west along the cell, the bluff becomes well-vegetated, and 
the beach becomes wider and is comprised of sand and pebbles, indicating
 northwestward net shore-drift.  An accretionary, sandy beach is located in 
northernmost Brigantine Bay, where it has accreted in front of a small wetland.
  The western end of the beach is the terminus of the cell, which 
abuts against a rock prominence.
