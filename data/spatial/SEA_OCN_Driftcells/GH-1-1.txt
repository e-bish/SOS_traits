This drift cell originates in Pacific County at a zone of divergence in the area of Cape Shoalwater, continues northward and terminates at the South Jetty at Point Chehalis.  Waves driven predominantly by southwest winds impinge on the shore at the zone of divergence causing sediment movement to the north as well as to the east into Willapa Bay.  Drift direction within this cell is indicated by sediments fining to the north.  The northward development of Point Chehalis,and progradation of the beach to the south (updrift of) the South Jetty, provide further evidence of a long-term net drift to the north in the area.
 

Note: The origin of this cell at Cape Shoalwater and the terminus of this drift cell at the South Jetty have been erosional probably since the 1960s. During the late 1980s the rate of erosion increased.
At South Jetty a parking lot and restrooms at Westhaven State Park were lost to erosion, and in December 1993 the South Jetty was breached. The Southwest Washington Coastal Erosion Study is gathering information on the coastal evolution, processes, geology, and hazards of the Columbia
River littoral cell.  The study area extends approximately 160 km along the Pacific Northwest coast between Tillamook Head, Oregon and Point Grenville, Washington. For information on the study
