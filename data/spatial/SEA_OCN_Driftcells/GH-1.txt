Point Brown quad
 
This drift cell begins at the northeastern end of the North Jetty, extends to the east,

 and terminates in a spit. The North Jetty of Grays Harbor extends to the southwest 

for roughly 2.5 km and consists of large rip-rap. Rip-rap continues from the northeastern
 
end of the North Jetty in the form of a submerged breakwater. It extends to the northeast 

to the tidal inlet near Oyhut Wildlife Area, a distance of approximately 2.0 km. Sediment 

transport occurs shoreward of the breakwater. At the origin of the drift cell, vegetated

dunes are being eroded. A peat layer near the beginning of this drift cell is also being eroded
 
with pieces of peat found for about 100 m to the east of the outcrop. Beach width increases 

significantly to the east. Grain size decreases slightly eastward with sand-sized 

grains topebbles found near the origin and medium to fine sand near the terminus. The drift 

cell terminus is a flat, unvegetated spit in front of the rip-rap that extends to the east. 

A large fetch across the open ocean drives sediment transport in this cell.
