Point Brown, Westport quads

This drift cell is located entirely on Damon Point which is a spit extending to the east. The cell wraps
 around the eastern end of the spit, and then extends to the north for a short distance. The origin of the
 drift cell is an erosional zone at the tidal inlet near the Oyhut Wildlife Area. Approximately .4 km
 of rip-rap is located on the backshore along the road. Sediment transport occurs seaward of this
 structure.



Beach width increases to the east with concentric beach ridges visible midway through the cell. A
slight decrease in grain size to the east is apparent; pebbles, granules, and sandsized grains are 
evident at the origin while only sand-sized grains are found near the terminus. Sediment 
transport in this drift cell is a result of an open ocean fetch on the west.
