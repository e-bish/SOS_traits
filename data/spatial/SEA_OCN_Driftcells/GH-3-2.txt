Point Brown quad

Beginning at a zone of divergence approximately two kilometers to the north of Point Brown this drift
 cell develops to the south with a terminus at the North Jetty.  Refraction of the dominant 
southwest waves producing northward drift results in a reverse circulation pattern in the lee of the
 North Jetty causing sediments to impinge on the shore at the zone of divergence and spread to the 
north and south. Net drift to the south of this cell is indicated by progradation of the shoreline between
 the zone of divergence and the South Jetty causing Point Brown to prograde westward
 faster than Point Chehalis.
 

Note: The Southwest Washington Coastal Erosion Study is gathering information on the evolution,
processes, geology, and hazards of the Columbia River littoral cell.  The study area
 extends approximately 160 km along the Pacific Northwest coast between Tillamook Head, Oregon
 and Point Grenville, Washington. For information on the study visit
