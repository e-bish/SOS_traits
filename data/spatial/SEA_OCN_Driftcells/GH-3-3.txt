Point Brown, Copalis Beach, Moclips, Shale Slough

Beginning at a zone of divergence to the north of Point Brown this 57 kilometer drift cell develops to
 the north as indicated by fining of the sediments in this direction.  Northward diversion of three major 
streams, to the north of Point Brown, provides further indication of the net drift direction.  The outlets
 of Conner Creek and the Copalis River and the Moclips River have all shifted a significant distance to
 the north in response to long term net drift along the shore in this direction. The cell that has a 
terminus at Point Grenville.


Note: The Southwest Washington Coastal Erosion Study is gathering information on the evolution, 
processes, geology, and hazards of the Columbia River littoral cell.  The study area extends 
approximately 160 km along the Pacific Northwest coast between Tillamook Head, Oregon and Point 
Grenville, Washington. For information on the study visit
