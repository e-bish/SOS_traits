Westport quad

This short drift cell originates near the northeastern tip of Damon Point, extends to the west, and
 terminates in a small, unvegetated, slightly hooked spit. A small 5 m stretch of rip-rap protects the
 parking lot and trail near the origin of the cell where vegetated dunes are eroding. Beach width
 increases slightly to the west with a beach ridge evident midway through the cell.  Sand-sized grains
 are prevalent. Net shore drift is due to an easterly local fetch.
