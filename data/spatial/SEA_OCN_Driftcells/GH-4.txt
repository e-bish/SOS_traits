Point Brown, Westport quads

Slight erosion of the bank indicates the origin of this west-trending drift cell which terminates at small 
bay on the south side of the Ocean Shores marina where sediment is accumulating. The .2 km long
 southern jetty is effective in blocking sediment transport. Beach width increases to the west in this 
drift cell. A slight decrease in grain size to the west is evident. Grain size ranges from granules and 
coarse sand near the origin to fine sand at the terminus. An easterly local fetch drives net 
shore-drift within this drift cell.
