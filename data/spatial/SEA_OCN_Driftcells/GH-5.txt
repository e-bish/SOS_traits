Point Brown quad

This drift cell originates on the northern side of the Ocean Shores marina, extends to the north, and terminates in a slightly hooked spit. Near the origin of this cell several badly eroded piling groins have accumulations on their south sides. These accumulations create a vertical offset of the beach surface averaging 20 cm higher on the south than on the north while an average horizontal offset landward of the shoreline of about .6 m was observed. Beach width increases significantly to the north while a decrease in grain size to the north was evident. Granules are found with coarse sand near the origin while only sand-sized particles are evident to the north. The drift cell terminates in a spit that is slightly hooked to the west. Transport of sediment within this cell is related to a local fetch from the south.

A rip-rap bulkhead extends fairly continuously for approximately 1.8 km northward from the northern jetty at the Ocean Shores marina. This bulkhead is built on the upper foreshore with sediment transport in this cell occurring seaward of the structure.
