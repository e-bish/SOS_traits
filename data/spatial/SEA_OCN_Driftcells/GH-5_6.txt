Point Brown, Copalis Crossing, Hoquiam, Aberdeen, Westport, Grayland quads

An area of no appreciable net shore-drift extends around the majority of inner Grays Harbor. 
The North Bay area East to the mouth of the Chehalis River is characterized by marshy vegetated 
areas and tidal flats. No appreciable net shore-drift occurs in this area due to the lack of sand-sized 
sediment and the prevalence of near-shore vegetation. Point New is an eroding bluff consisting 
of ancient estuary deposits. These deposits generally contain silt- and clay-sized grains and therefore 
do not provide sediment for littoral transport.

In the Bowerman basin area, rip-rap protects approximately 1.8 km of the shore beginning near Grays
 Harbor City and extending to the east. Highway 109 parallels the shore in this location. For approximately
 8.5 km from south of the Bowerman airport, near Hoquiam, eastward to Aberdeen the shore is intermittently
 protected by rip-rap or is an industrialized shore. Aberdeen and Hoquiam have partially industrialized shores.

Rennie Island, south of Hoquiam, is an area of no appreciable net shore-drift resulting from a lack of sand-sized 
sediment and the prevalence of marshy vegetation along the shore of this island.

Tidal flats and marshy vegetation are concentrated along the margins of the shore southwest of the 
Chehalis River, around South Bay and north to Westport. There is no sand-sized sediment available
 for transport in this area. Eroding estuarine bluffs are located near South Arbor but are too fine-grained 
to contribute sediment for littoral transport.
