Westport quad

This drift cell originates on the southern side of the Westport marina facilities, 

extends to the southeast, and terminates in a spit. At the origin of this drift cell,

 erosion of vegetated dunes is apparent while the terminus of the drift cell, a spit, 

is fairly flat and unvegetated. Also near the origin, a peat layer is eroding with peat 

pieces found for approximately 100 m to the southeast of the outcrop. Beach width 

increases to the southeast in this drift cell and terminates in a southeast-trending spit.

Sand-sized sediment is prevalent along the entire length of this drift cell. Sediment 

transport within this cell is most likely related to both local fetch from the northwest 

and refracted open ocean waves.
