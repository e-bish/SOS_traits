Taholah quad

Beginning at the north side of Point Grenville this drift cell is 5.5 kilometers
 long and has a terminus approximately 1 kilometer to the east of Cape
 Elizabeth on the north bank of the Quinault River.  Drift direction to the
 north is indicated by a rise in beach elevation and beach widening from
 south to north.  A spit approximately 200 meters long, developed to the 
north partially across the mouth of the Quinault River, is further evidence
 of a net drift to the north for this cell.
