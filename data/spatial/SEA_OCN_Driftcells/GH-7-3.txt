Taholah, Tunnel Island quads

This drift cell originates at the north side of Cape Elizabeth and continues 
5.2 kilometers to the north, terminating at the base of Pratt Cliff. Evidence
 of net shore drift to the north for this cell includes an increase in beach
 elevation and width as the cell develops from south to north.  Camp Creek
 at the terminus of this cell is deflected to the north by the accumulation of
 beach sediments for approximately 150 meters, before turning to the west
 and discharging into the sea, providing further evidence of drift direction
 to the north.
