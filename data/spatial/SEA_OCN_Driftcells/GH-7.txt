Westport quad

This drift cell has its source in the sand carried into the inlet from the east end
 of the log-spiral beach to the west. Drift direction is identified by the accumulation
 of sand-sized sediment on the western side of the five western-most large rip-rap
 groins. Horizontal and vertical offsets of up to 1 m were observed as a result of this
 sediment accumulation that indicates eastward transport. This drift cell terminates
 at the fifth groin from the western end. Transport within this cell is a result of a long
 fetch on the west across the open ocean.
