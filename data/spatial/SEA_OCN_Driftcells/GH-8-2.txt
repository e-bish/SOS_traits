Tunnel Island, Queets quads

Beginning at the north side of Pratt Cliff this drift cell continues to the north for
 approximately 43 kilometers, terminating at the mouth of the Queets River
 in Jefferson County. The direction of net shore drift is indicated by an
 increase in beach elevation and width as the result of movement of
 beach sediments from south to north.  Sediments coming from two
 creeks and the Raft River flowing into the drift cell, tend to fine to the
 north. Beach sediment accumulated near the terminus of this drift cell
 have diverted the Queets River to the north for approximately 2.4 kilometers
 before it turns west and flows into the ocean.  Sediment fining occurs within
 the 2.4 kilometer stretch of beach which is not subjected to direct erosion of
 near-vertical bluffs characterizing the shore of the remainder of the drift cell.
