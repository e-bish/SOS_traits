Point Brown, Westport quads

This drift cell originates to the west of Westhaven, extends to the southwest, 
and terminates near the South Jetty at Point Chehalis. This drift cell is located 
within the confines of a log-spiral beach and exhibits southwestward transport. 
Sediment is most likely derived from reworking of sediment that composes the spit. 
Beach width increases to the southwest while a slight decrease in sediment size to 
the southwest was apparent. Sand-sized grains prevail in this drift cell with coarser 
sand found near the origin and finer sand near the terminus. Sediment accumulation on 
the northeast sides of two rip-rap groins perpendicular to the beach indicate southwestward 
transport. However, in the winter of 1993, the area to the south of the South Jetty was 
breached. Presently, the situation is being modified by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
A large volume of sand is being pumped into the breached area as a temporary measure 
until a more permanent solution is agreed upon. This artificial nourishment has drastically 
altered the drift patterns at the end of this drift cell. Net shore drift within this cell is likely 
a result of refracted ocean waves from the west.

The South Jetty at Grays Harbor extends to the west from the beach for roughly 2.2 km and consists of large rip-rap.
