Roche Harbor quad

This cell is located in western Nelson Bay and has net shore-drift to the
 southwest and south for 1.2 km.  Net shore-drift originates at the south side
 of an unnamed headland at the mouth of the bay, where a narrow beach begins.  
Beach width increases and the mean sediment size decreases to the southwest in
 two segments; from the origin to a depositional feature created by 
intermittent northeastward drift from the head of the bay to the feature, and 
secondly, along the southern portion of this cell ending at the head of the bay, 
indicating southwestward and southward net shore-drift.  Near the southern end 
of the cell, the beach has prograded in front of a former marsh that is located 
northwest of a dock, and further to the southeast, a spit has prograded southeastward 
in front of a large marsh at the head of Nelson Bay, diverting a small tidal channel 
in the same direction, further indicating net shore-drift towards the head of the bay.
