Roche Harbor quad

This cell is located along the eastern approach and eastern shore of Nelson Bay.  
Net shore-drift goes into Nelson Bay.  Net shore-drift originates in front of the Seattle 
Yacht Club marina on the north end of this portion of Henry Island.  Westward and 
southwestward net shore-drift in this sector is indicated by local beach width increase 
to the west and southwest between rock outcrops partially interrupting drift, sediment 
accumulations on the east and northeast side of rock outcrops, a mid-bay spit that has 
prograded to the southwest, located approximately half way along the eastern shore 
of Nelson Bay, and nearshore bars oriented northeast-southwest that are moving onshore
to the south within Nelson Bay.  The terminus of the cell is located at the distal end of the spit.
