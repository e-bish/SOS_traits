Roche Harbor quad

This cell  is located along Mosquito Pass with northeastward net shore-drift 
for 0.6 km to the small cuspate spit west of Pole Island. Net shore-drift originates 
from a poorly-vegetated bluff consisting of glacial till.  Indicators of northeastward 
net shore-drift are northeastward bluff vegetation and beach width increase, 
northeastward sediment size decrease, sediment accumulation on the southwest 
side of rock outcrops partially interrupting drift, and progradation of a small cuspate 
spit located west of Pole Island.  Net shore-drift terminates at the cuspate spit.
