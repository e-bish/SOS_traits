Roche Harbor quad

This cell is located along central Mosquito Pass with southwestward net shore-drift.  
This cell originates along a poorly-vegetated and eroding bluff cut into glacial till, 
and transports a small volume of drift sediment for 400 m to a concave shore sector.  
Southwestward net shore-drift is evidenced by southwestward bluff vegetation 
increase and sediment size decrease, progradation of the tombolo that connects 
easternmost Henry Island to the rest of the island, and the orientation of swash bars 
welding onto the beachface towards the southwest.  Net shore-drift terminates at the
southern extent of the low elevation portion of the island.
