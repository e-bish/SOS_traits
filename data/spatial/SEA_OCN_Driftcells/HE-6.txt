Roche Harbor quad

This cell is located directly west of White Point (San Juan Island), across Mosquito 
Pass on eastern Henry Island.  Net shore-drift originates from an erosional bluff 
consisting of sandy glacial drift, and goes northwestward for 300 m.  Northwestward 
net shore-drift is indicated by northwestward beach width increase and sediment size 
decrease, progradation of the beach in front of a marsh, and northwetward stream 
mouth offset near the cell terminus.
