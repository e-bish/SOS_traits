Roche Harbor quad

This cell is located along southern Mosquito Pass.  Net shore-drift is to the south for 400 m.  
Southward net shore-drift is evidenced by southward beach width increase, sediment size 
decrease, and progradation of a sandy spit.  A 120-m-wide depositional area has filled in with 
sediment between the prograded beach and uplands in this cell.  A spit platform is present south 
of the sandy spit, the distal end of which represents the terminus of this drift cell.  No appreciable 
net shore-drift occurs along the rocky shore of southwest Henry Island, in Open Bay (where several 
large pocket beaches are found), along rocky Kellett Bluff, and along western Henry Island. Very 
minimal glacial drift deposits are located along these rocky shores.
