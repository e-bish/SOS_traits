Roche Harbor quad

No appreciable net shore-drift occurs along the rocky shore of southwest Henry Island, 
in Open Bay (where several large pocket beaches are found), along rocky Kellett Bluff, 
and along western Henry Island. Very minimal glacial drift deposits are located along 
these rocky shores.
