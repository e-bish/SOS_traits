Roche Harbor quad

This cell is located along Haro Strait on the western shore of northern Henry Island.  
Net shore-drift is northeastward for 1.1 km to the northern tip of the island.  The origin 
of this cell is located 0.9 km southwest of McCracken Point on the northeastern side of 
a gently-convex shore sector.  The rocky shore of western Henry Island changes to glacial 
drift intermittently overlying bedrock at this location, providing drift sediment for this cell.  
Northeastward net shore-drift is indicated by northeastward sediment size decrease, 
sediment accumulation on the southwest side of McCracken Point, and northeastward 
progradation of a short tombolo located north of McCracken Point.  Net shore-drift terminates 
at the northernmost extent of Henry Island.
