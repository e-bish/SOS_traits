Mukilteo, Maxwelton quads

This drift cell originates at the southeast portion of Possession Point (southeast Whidbey Island, )
 
and has generally northward net shore-drift for approximately 16 km to Sandy Point.  The origin 

of the cell at southeast Possession Point consists of a 105-m-high bluff cut into sandy glacial drift.
  
The bluff is poorly vegetated and shows evidence of recent landslides.  An armored beach with a 

narrow high-tide beach fronts the bluff.  Peat that is exposed 25 to 35 m up the bluff face is delivered
 
to the beach from erosion of the bluff at the cell origin.  Peat is found on the beach in pieces of 

3-m-length or larger at the cell origin.  North of the cell origin, the bluff becomes well-vegetated
 
and relatively stable, and the gravel that comprises the low tide beach decreases in size, from 
boulders at the cell origin to cobbles (with sand) north of Randall Point (Mukilteo quadrangle).  
Generally northward net shore-drift is indicated by northward bluff vegetation increase, northward 
sediment size decrease on the low tide beach, pieces of peat decreasing in size to the north (from 
1 to 2 m in length near the cell origin to 2 to 8 cm in length north of Randall Point), sediment 
accumulations consistently occurring on the south side of many boat ramps and groins along the 
length of the cell (vertical offsets range up to 1 m), and northward offset of stream mouths located 
1.5 km north of Glendale and 0.8 km northwest of Randall Point.  Northerly net shore-drift is further 
evidenced by the progradation of Sandy Point, a cuspate spit. The cell terminus is located at the 
distal end of Sandy Spit.
