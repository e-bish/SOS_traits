Maxwelton quad

This cell originates from a zone of drift divergence at Possession Point.  Net shore-drift is northwestward 
then northeastward for 2.5 km into Cultus Bay.  The bluff at the cell origin is poorly-vegetated and erosional. 
Northwest of Possession Point, the bluff is well-vegetated.  Pieces of peat that are generally 1 to 3 m in length 
near their source (at the cell origin) are found alongshore to the northwest in decreasing sizes.  A second type
of identifiable sediment, broken chunks of pavement from the edge of a parking lot at the top of the bluff, 
enter the littoral system 0.7 km northwest of Possession Point.  Pavement clasts can be found in decreasing 
sizes from their source to the northwest then to the northeast.  

Northwestward then northeastward net shore-drift is evidenced by northwestward bluff vegetation increase, 
sediment size decrease on the low tide beach, northwestward then northeastward drift of identifiable sediment, 
large sediment accumulation on the south side of a rip-rap and timber jetty located 0.8 km northwest of 
Possession Point and at numerous small groins on Sandy Hook, and northeastward progradation of the Sandy 
Hook spit for 0.8 km into eastern Cultus Bay.  The large rip-rap and timber jetty at the base of Sandy Hook partially
 interrupts northward net shore-drift, by diverting a portion of the drift sediment into the dredged channel seaward 
of it, removing it from the littoral system.  The drift cell terminus is located at the northern end of Sandy Hook.
