Maxwelton quad

This cell originates at Scatchet Head and has generally northeastward net shore-drift for 
2.8 km to the head of Cultus Bay.  Scatchet Head is a 90-m-elevation bluff comprised of 
sandy glacial drift.  The bluff is poorly vegetated and erosional, and has recently experienced 
large landslides along an approximately 1.5-km-wide area.  (Bluff erosion due to southerly wave 
attack is augmented here by the presence of mostly-impermeable clay deposits near the base 
of the bluff).  The cell originates in a broad zone of drift divergence located west of a large rip-rap 
seawall that extends well into the shallow nearshore zone, fronting the southeast-facing portion of 
Scatchet Head.  The seawall eliminates the portion of drift sediment that was supplied by erosion 
of the bluff behind the seawall, but does not inhibit the passage of sediment.  Net shore-drift is to 
the northeast in front of and around the seawall and into Cultus Bay.

Northeastward net shore-drift is evidenced by northeastward bluff vegetation and beach width 
increase, generally northeastward beach width increase, northeastward sediment size decrease 
on the low tide beach, nearshore bars oriented east-west, moving north eastward, eastward spit 
progradation in northern Cultus Bay (the western segment of which is now a beach fronting a large 
marsh), and associated eastward stream mouth offset.  The cell terminus is located in a broad zone 
of deposition in northern Cultus Bay, extending eastward to the distal end of the sandy spit.
