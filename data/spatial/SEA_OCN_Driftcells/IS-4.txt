Maxwelton quad

Net shore-drift in this cell originates at Scatchet Head and goes generally 
northwestward for 12 km to the head of Useless Bay.  Scatchet Head is a 
broad zone of drift divergence. Scatchet Head and the near-linear reach of 
bluff that is located northwest of Scatchet Head are poorly-vegetated and 
erosional, supplying abundant sand and gravel to the shore drift system. 
Generally northwestward net shore-drift from Scatchet Head to Maxwelton 
is evidenced by westward spit progradation at locations 1 km west and 2 km 
northwest of Scatchet Head, sediment accumulations on the southeast side of 
large boulder piles on the beachface (located between 1 and 2 km southeast 
of Indian Point), nearshore bars oriented east-west, moving northwestward 
towards Indian Point, northwestward bluff vegetation and beach width increase, 
northwestward sediment size decrease on the low tide beach, sediment 
accumulations on the south side of several wooden groins immediately north 
of Indian Point, the occurrence of peat clasts of decreasing size to the northwest 
from their source at Scatchet Head, and from a second source 0.9 km southeast of 
Indian Point.  Generally northwestward net shore-drift from Maxwelton to the head 
of Useless Bay is indicated by sediment accumulations on the south side of several 
wooden groins immediately north of and 2 km north of Maxwelton, northward stream 
mouth offset seaward of a tide gate (located 1.0 km north of Maxwelton), northward 
peat clast size decrease until fresh peat input from an erosional bluff located 2.5 km 
north of Maxwelton, sediment size decrease on the low tide beach, northwestward 
progradation of a 1.0-km-long spit immediately southeast of Sunlight Beach and of the 
1.5-km-long bayhead spit called Sunlight Beach (which is currently a beach fronting a 
large marsh), and sediment accumulation on the southeast side of more than 20 small 
groins along Sunlight Beach.  The drift cell terminus is located at the distal, recurved 
end of the Sunlight Beach spit, landward of the entrance to Deer Lagoon.
