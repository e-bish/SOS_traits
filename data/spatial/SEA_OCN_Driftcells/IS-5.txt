Maxwelton and Hansville quads

This cell originates approximately 2 km east of Double Bluff (southwest Whidbey Island, Hansville quadrangle) 
and has northeastward net shore-drift for 3.8 km along the Useless Bay shore to the mouth of Deer Lagoon 
(Maxwelton quadrangle).  The cell originates at a zone of drift divergence located south and southwest of 
Oliver Lake along a 110-m-high bluff that faces southeast, the direction of maximum fetch (34 km fetch).  
The bluff here is similar to the bluff at Scatchet Head (see adjacent cell to the east).  There is evidence 
of recent erosion here; the bluff is poorly-vegetated and steep, and has experienced recent landslides.  
Bluff erosion contributes abundant sand and gravel to the beach fronting it.  Peat outcrops in the bluff 
and occurs on the beach in pieces of 3-m-length or more at the cell origin.  A sandy high-tide beach and
 a boulder and cobble low-tide beach front the bluff at the cell origin. Northeastward net shore-drift is 
evidenced by northeastward bluff vegetation and beach width increase (including the accretion of a 
number a pebble-rich beach ridges located southwest of Oliver Lake in a broad beach ridge and drift 
log accretion area), northeastward sediment size decrease on the low tide beach, the occurrence of 
peat clasts on the beach of decreasing size to the northeast, sediment accumulation on the southwest 
side of a rip-rap revetment fronting a county park at the base of a spit and at several groins along the 
spit, northeastward progradation of a 2.5-km-long bayhead spit, and nearshore bars trending east-west, 
moving northeastward along most of the cell length. The distal end of the spit in northern Useless Bay 
(Maxwelton quadrangle) consists of a recurve that extends to the north-northeast on top of a broad tideflat,
leaving only a narrow channel into intertidal Deer Lagoon.  The cell terminus is located at the distal end of the spit.
