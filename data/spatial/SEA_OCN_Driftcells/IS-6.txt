Net shore-drift in this cell originates east of Double Bluff and has westward, 
then generally northward, net shore-drift along the shore of Mutiny Bay to 
Bush Point.  The shore configuration and sedimentation and erosion patterns 
in this cell closely resemble those of the cell that originates at Scatchet Head 
to the south.  The concave nature of the shore between the two points that 
comprise Double Bluff appears to have been formed by erosion, probably by 
a large landslide or amphitheater-shaped bluff failure.  (A probable cause of
 bluff failure would be the lack of drainage through the mostly impermeable 
beds near the base of the bluff instigating bluff failure.)  This cell originates from 
a broad zone of drift divergence located 1.5 km east of Double Bluff.  The bluff 
here is poorly-vegetated and steep, and shows signs of rapid erosion, contributing 
abundant sand and gravel to the shore drift system.  Westward then northwestward 
net shore-drift from the cell origin to Double Bluff is evidenced by westward bluff 
vegetation and low tide beach width increase, the occurrence of peat clasts of 
decreasing size to the west and northwest as they get further from the source 
(the cell origin), and nearshore bars trending east-west, moving northwestward 
along the concave shore sector immediately southeast of Double Bluff. 
 Net shore-drift continues around Double Bluff and goes generally northward 
past the village of Austin and beyond the northern study area boundary, as 
evidenced by continued northward bluff vegetation and beach width increase, 
the progradation of a low elevation platform immediately north of Double Bluff, 
and sediment accumulation on the south side of boat launching tracks and a 
boat ramp just north of Double Bluff, at a boat ramp near Austin, and at the 
base of two piers just north of the study area boundary.  Net shore-drift continues
to the northwest to Bush Point, a cuspate spit located approximately 7 km northwest 
of Austin.
