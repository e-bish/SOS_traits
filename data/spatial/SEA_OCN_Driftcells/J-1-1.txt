(Queets, Destruction Island and Hoh Head quads)
The Jefferson County drift cell map (Mahala 1984) reports a large drift cell
 originating in northern Grays Harbor County at the north side
of Pratt Cliff and terminating just north of the
Hoh River.  Net shore-drift to the north is
indicated by the northward deflection of the Queets River and Kalaloch
Creek.  A sand and gravel spit built across the mouth of the Queets
River has caused a northward deflection of approximately 2 kilometers.
The straight linearity of this coastal segment permits unimpeded
northward sediment transport by longshore processes. Northward 
net shore-drift is further indicated by the northward deflection of Cedar Creek and
the Hoh River, and by drift obstruction at a rocky headland showing
sediment accumulation on the south side.  The Hoh River is deflected
approximately 1 kilometer to the north by a sand and gravel spit built
in the direction of net shore-drift.  A small protruding headland just
north of the Destruction Island viewpoint acts as a partial obstruction
to shore drift with sediment accumulation on its south side.


 According to the Grays Harbor County drift cell map (Bronson 1984),
 there is a sub-cell within this larger
 cell that terminates to the north at
the mouth of the Queets River.  Sediments coming from two creeks
and the Raft River in Grays Harbor flow into the drift cell,
 and tend to fine to the north.  Beach sediments accumulated near the
terminus of this drift cell have diverted the Queets River to the north
2.4 kilometers before it turns west and flows into the ocean.  Sediment
fining occurs within the 2.4 kilometer stretch of beach which is not
subjected to erosion of near-vertical bluffs which characterize the
shoreline of the remainder of this sub-drift cell area.
