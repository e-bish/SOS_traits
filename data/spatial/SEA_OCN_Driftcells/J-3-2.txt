(Hoh Head quad) 
This drift cell begins south of Jefferson Cove and terminates along
its northern shore.  Northward net shore-drift is indicated by an
increase in beach width and an accumulation of heavy driftwood to the
north. 
 

Hoh Head and the adjacent coastline to the north and south are
characterized by no apparent net shore-drift.  Deep water lies
immediately offshore of the nearly vertical cliffs of sandstone making
up Hoh Head, one of the most prominent headlands within the scope of
this study.
