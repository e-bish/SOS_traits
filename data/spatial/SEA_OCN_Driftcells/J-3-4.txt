(Hoh Head and Toleak Point quads)
This drift cell originates just south of Mosquito Creek
 and terminates at the mouth of Goodman Creek.
Sediment supplied by Mosquito Creek, and beach erosion, is transported
north to form a wide sandy beach extending approximately 3 km to the
north.  Net shore-drift to the north is indicated by a decrease in
beach sediment size and an increase in beach width to the north, as well as 
by numerous large pieces of driftwood fallen across the beach
showing sediment accumulation on the south side. The headlands immediately
 north of Goodman Creek are characterized by no appreciable
net shore-drift due to the presence of deep water directly offshore.
