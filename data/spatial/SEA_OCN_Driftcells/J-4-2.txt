(Toleak Point quad)
This drift cell originates immediately north of the headland at Goodman
Creek and terminates on the south side of Strawberry Point.  Net
shore-drift to the north is indicated by an increase in beach width
northward toward Toleak Point.  Shore drift continues around Toleak
Point and is transported northward at Strawberry Point to form a
tombolo.  Strawberry Point has an asymmetrical form with more sediment
built up on its south side, which is the terminus of this cell.
