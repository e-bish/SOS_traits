(Toleak Point quad)
This drift cell begins at the northern side of Strawberry Point and
terminates immediately south of Taylor Point.  Net shore-drift to the
north is indicated by an increase in beach width to the north and an
accumulation of sediment on the south side of a small headland just
north of Scott Creek, which acts as a partial obstruction to shore
drift.  Taylor Point is an area of no appreciable net shore-drift due
to the presence of deep water immediately offshore of this major
headland and associated stacks.
