(Quillayute Prairie and Toleak Point quads)
This drift cell originates just south of Teahwhit Head and terminates at the southern
reach of Third Beach at Strawberry Bay .  Net
shore-drift to the south is indicated by a small stream diversion of
approximately 50 m to the south, with sediment buildup, about 2-3 m, on
the southern bank.  The southern end of Third Beach is also built up
with a greater volume of sediment there than at the northern end.
Teahwhit Head is another prominent headland characterized by no
appreciable net shore-drift and marks the northern extent of Strawberry
Bay.
