(Port Ludlow quadrangle)
Cell JE-1 originates in a broad zone of drift divergence in southern
Oak Bay and has northward net shore-drift to the northern end of Oak
Bay (Kueler, 1988), which is north of the study area boundary (48o N).
A small volume of sediment is transported in this cell.  The shore at
the cell origin consists of a near-vertical, poorly-vegetated bluff
composed of sandstone and glacial drift that is fronted by a narrow
beach armored with 20 to 60 cm clasts.  Northward net shore-drift is
indicated by a northward bluff vegetation and beach width increase, and
sediment size decrease, from coarse gravel to fine gravel and sand.
Northward net shore-drift is also indicated by the northeastward
progradation of a 0.8-km-long bayhead spit in northern Oak Bay, which
has been anchored with rip-rap.  The cell terminus is located against
the western side of two rip-rap jetties stabilizing the Portage Canal,
which passes inside of Indian Island.
