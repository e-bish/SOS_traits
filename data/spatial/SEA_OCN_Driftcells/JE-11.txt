(Lofall quadrangle)

Cell JE-11 originates in eastern Squamish Harbor and has westward net
shore-drift for 3.2 km to the northwestern corner of Squamish Harbor.
Net shore-drift originates at an erosional bluff composed of
stratified, sandy glacial drift (discussed in cell JE-10).  Westward
net shore-drift is evidenced by westward bluff vegetation and beach
width increase, sediment size decrease, sediment accumulations on the
east side of a boat ramp located 0.8 km west of the cell origin, and at
a concrete jetty and a rip-rap revetment (both located in front of the
town of Shine), nearshore bars trending northeast-southwest, moving
westward, and the westward progradation of a wide, sandy spit in front
of a marsh that has caused westward stream mouth offset at the cell
terminus in northwesternmost Squamish Harbor.
