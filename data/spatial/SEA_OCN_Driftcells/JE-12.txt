(Lofall quadrangle)

Cell JE-12 originates in southern Squamish Harbor and has northward net
shore-drift for 3.0 km to northwest Squamish Harbor.  Net shore-drift
in this cell originates immediately north of a rip-rap jetty located
between the two 1.0-km-long spits that are found north of South Point.
The jetty was installed during development of a small harbor located
landward of the southern of the two spits that includes that
Bridgehaven Marina.  The jetty has interrupted northward net
shore-drift from cell JE-13.  The spit immediately north of the cell
origin prograded northward in the past, but is now becoming detached
from the mainland due to a reduction in the volume of sediment reaching
it (sediment volume may have been reduced because of the progradation
of the spit near South Point, located up-drift of it, by the
proliferation of seawalls near South Point and along the spit north of
South Point, or by the installation of the rip-rap jetty between the
two spits.)

Northward net shore-drift in cell JE-12 is indicated by northward beach
width increase (north of the spit), sediment accumulations on the south
side of several large trees lying across the beach 3.0 km north of South
Point, and northward progradation of a small spit located 300 m south of
the northwest corner of Squamish Harbor.  Net shore-drift terminates at
the shallow delta present in northwest Squamish Harbor.
