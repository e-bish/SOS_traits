(Seabeck quadrangle)

Cell JE-14 originates from a zone of drift divergence in common with
cell JE-13 located approximately 3.6 km north of Hazel Point, and has
southward and southeastward net shore-drift to Hazel Point.  The
northeast-facing nature of this sector exposes it to northerly fetch of
up to 27 km, causing southward and southeastward net shore-drift.
Southward net shore-drift is evidenced by southward bluff vegetation
and beach width increase, sediment accumulations on the north side of
boat ramps located 1.9 and 2.8 km northwest of Hazel Point, southward
stream mouth offset located 1.8 km northwest of Hazel Point, and the
progradation of Hazel Point, a small cuspate spit that contains ponded
water and abundant drift logs.  The drift cell terminus is located at
the tip of Hazel Point.  Much of the net shore-drift sediment reaching
Hazel Point may be lost to deep water off the Point (water depth is in
excess of 70 m just 90 m seaward of the tip of Hazel Point).
