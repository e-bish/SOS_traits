(Seabeck quadrangle)

Cell JE-15 is located along the southern shore of the Toandos
Peninsula, originating from a broad zone of drift divergence between
Tskutsko Point and Oak Head, where a bluff is cut into sandy glacial
drift.  Net shore-drift is to the southeast around Oak Head then
northeastward to Hazel Point for a total length of 4.2 km.
Southeastward net shore-drift to Oak Head is indicated by southeastward
bluff vegetation and beach width increase, and sediment size decrease.
Northeastward net shore-drift from Oak Head to Hazel Point is indicated
by northeastward beach width increase and sediment size decrease,
northeastward progradation of a baymouth spit most of the way across
the very shallow entrance to Fisherman Harbor (which does not prohibit
most drift sediment from crossing it), and progradation of the small
cuspate spit called Hazel Point, where the cell terminus is located.
Much of the sediment reaching Hazel Point may be lost to deep water off
the Point, where water is in excess of 70 m deep 90 m seaward of the
tip of Hazel Point.
