(Seabeck and Quilcene quadrangles)

Cell JE-16 is a 21-km-long cell with northward net shore-drift along
the full length of the eastern shore of Dabob Bay (western Toandos
Peninsula), making it the longest drift cell in eastern Jefferson
County.  The drift cell origin is a broad zone of drift divergence
located approximately 1.0 km northwest of Oak Head.  Generally
northward net shore-drift is indicated by northeastward stream mouth
offset at a location 0.7 km northeast of Zelatched Point, northward
stream mouth offset at a location 2.6 km south of Tabook Point,
northward progradation of two spits and associated northward stream
mouth offset immediately north of Camp Harmony, sediment accumulation
on the south side of a rock groin located 2.0 north of Camp Harmony and
a set of four rock groins located 4.0 km north of Camp Harmony,
nearshore bars oriented northwest-southeast and moving north between
Camp Harmony and Camp Discovery, northward stream mouth offset at Camp
Discovery, the erosional nature of the bluff at the southwest-facing
shore located 2.0 km north of Camp Discovery and northward bluff
vegetation increase from this location, and the northward progradation
of the 1.5-km-long spit (Long Spit) and associated northward stream mouth
offset in northern Dabob Bay.  The cell terminus is located at the
northern end of Long Spit.
