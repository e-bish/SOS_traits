(Quilcene quadrangle)

Cell JE-17 is a 9.5-km-long cell that originates from southern Bolton
Peninsula and has generally northward net shore-drift along the western
shore of Dabob Bay to Tarboo Bay.  Net shore-drift in this cell
originates at a broad zone of drift divergence located within the first
kilometer southeast of Fishermans Point, between 0.8 and 1.6 km west of
Red Bluff.  The shore here consists of a bluff cut into red,
coarse-grained sandstone and conglomerate that is overlain by sandy
glacial drift and is fronted by a poorly sorted beach.  The bluff is
poorly-vegetated and steep, and has experienced a recent slope failure,
indicating its erosional nature.  Evidence of northeastward then
northward net shore-drift is provided by northeastward bluff vegetation
increase, the presence of red sand northeast of the outcrop of red
sandstone present at the cell origin, northeastward and northward
sediment size decrease, northward progradation of Broad Spit, nearshore
bars oriented northeast-southwest moving to the north in northern Dabob
Bay, and the northeastward progradation of several bay head bars located
directly west of the town of Dabob.  The distal end of the active
(southern), recurved, bayhead bar is the end of this cell.  Tarboo Bay
is a mud flat north of the terminus of cells JE-16 and 17 that is filling
in with sediment supplied by Tarboo Creek.
