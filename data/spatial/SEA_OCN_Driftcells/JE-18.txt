(Quilcene quadrangle)

This cell originates from a broad zone of drift divergence located
southeast of Fishermans Point and has northward net shore-drift along
the eastern shore of Quilcene Bay for 4.2 km to a location 1.3 km south
of East Quilcene.  A poorly-vegetated bluff cut into glacial drift is
located at the cell origin.  Northwestward net shore-drift around
Fisherman Point and northward net shore-drift up Quilcene Bay is
indicated by a northwestward bluff vegetation increase, northward and
northeastward spit progradation from Fishermans Point, northward
sediment size decrease, nearshore bars oriented northwest-southeast,
moving to the north between 2 and 4 km north of Fishermans Point, and
sediment accumulation on the south side of the base of a short causeway
that fronts a log trans-shipment facility near the northern end of
Quilcene Bay.  The drift cell terminus is located at the base of this
causeway, as shallow depths in northern Quilcene Bay prohibit waves
from forming that are large enough to cause a significant amount of
sediment transport.  Northern Quilcene Bay is gradually filling with
sediment transported by the Quilcene River and Donovan Creek.
