(Quilcene quadrangle)

Cell JE-19 originates in a zone of drift divergence located 0.8 km
south of Frenchmans Point at the mouth of Quilcene Bay and has
northward net shore-drift to the Quilcene Boat Haven marina.  The cell
origin is located at a bluff composed of glacial drift intermittently
overlying basalt, that is fronted by a narrow, steep beach armored with
10 to 60 cm clasts.  Where basalt outcrops, it is present in small
promontories, that are gradually eroded along joint planes.  This is an
area that shows evidence of recent bluff failures in glacial drift,
indicating its erosional nature.  Northward net shore-drift is
indicated by northward bluff vegetation and beach width increase,
sediment size decrease, stream mouth offset at Frenchmans Point, and
sediment accumulation on the south side of several rock outcrops that
cross the beach and at the base of the rip-rapped marina at Quilcene
Boat Haven, where the drift cell terminus is located.  Shallow depths
in northern Quilcene Bay prohibit the formation of waves that are
large enough to cause a significant amount of sediment transport.
Northern Quilcene Bay is gradually shoaling with sediment transported
by the Quilcene River and Donovan Creek.
