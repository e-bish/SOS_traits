(Port Ludlow quadrangle)
The cell originates at the southern end of the zone of drift divergence
in common with cell JE-1 and has southeastward net shore-drift,
terminating 1.3 km west of Olele Point.  This cell represents a
1.1-km-long, local drift direction reversal, in contrast to generally
northward net shore-drift within Oak Bay (cell JE-1 and Kueler, 1988).
Local drift reversal results from the protection that Olele Point
offers from the southerly winds that cause northward net shore-drift in
most sectors of the Hood Canal.  Southeastward net shore-drift is
evidenced by southeastward bluff vegetation and beach width increase,
and southeastward sediment size decrease.  Net shore-drift sediment is
deposited in an accretionary sandy beach with multiple pebble and
cobble beach ridges located along the concave shore reach west of Olele
Point.
