(Quilcene quadrangle)

This cell represents a short (1.5 km), local reversal in the overall
northward net shore-drift that is characteristic of Dabob and Quilcene
bays.  Net shore-drift is to the southeast in this cell.  This is due
to the northeast-facing orientation of the shore immediately west of
Whitney Point and the 7 km northerly and northeasterly fetch that this
area is exposed to, in contrast to the surrounding shore that is
generally not exposed to northerly fetch.  The cell origin is located
1.0 km south of Frenchmans Point at an erosional area (see cell
JE-19).  Southeastward net shore-drift is indicated by southeastward
bluff vegetation and beach width increase, sediment size decrease, and
stream mouth offset at 1.3 and 1.9 km south of Frenchmans Point.  The
cell terminus is located in a zone of drift convergence in common with
cell JE-21 at Bees Mill, centered approximately 300 m west of the State
Shellfish Laboratory where a wide beach is present.
