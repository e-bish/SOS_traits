(Quilcene and Seabeck quadrangles)

Cell JE-21 originates 1.0 km north of Pulali Point (Seabeck quadrangle)
within Dabob Bay and has northward then northwestward net shore-drift
for 2.5 km, depositing at Bees Mill (Quilcene quadrangle).  Northward
and northwestward net shore-drift is indicated by northward beach width
increase and sediment size decrease, and northwestward spit
progradation at Bees Mill.  After rounding Whitney Point, net
shore-drift continues for several hundred meters in front of a small
estuary before terminating at a zone of drift convergence located at
Bees Mill.  The beach is greater than 100 m wide at the drift cell
terminus.

No appreciable net shore-drift occurs from the origin of cell JE-21
south to Pulali Point and within the eastern and northern shores of
Jackson Cove.  The shore in this area is comprised of basalt that has
a wave-cut terrace of varying width but is devoid of a continuous beach.
Within Jackson Cove, several large pocket beaches are present between
basalt promontories.  The westernmost pocket beach receives sediment
from Spencer Creek.
