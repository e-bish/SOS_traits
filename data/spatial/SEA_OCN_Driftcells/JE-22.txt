(Seabeck quadrangle)

Cell JE-22 is an isolated net shore-drift cell located in western
Jackson Cove.  It has northward net shore-drift for 0.9 km, with a
relatively small volume of sediment transport occurring, as the
sediment supply in this area is limited to glacial drift that
intermittently overlays basalt.  The cell origin is located 0.6 km
north of Wawa Point.  Generally northward net shore-drift is evidenced
by northward beach width increase and sediment size decrease, sediment
accumulations on the south side of rock outcrops partially interrupting
drift near the cell origin, and northward offset of the Marple Creek
delta.  The drift cell terminus is located at the northern end of the
beach where it meets the southern side of the Spencer Creek delta.  A
60-m-wide beach is present here.

No appreciable net shore-drift occurs from the origin of cell JE-22
south to Wawa Point, and around the southern shore of the Wawa Point
peninsula.  The shore here consists of basalt that lacks a continuous
beach.
