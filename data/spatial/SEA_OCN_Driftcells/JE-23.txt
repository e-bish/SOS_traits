(Brinnon quadrangle)

This is a 300-m-long cell that originates 200 m west of Wawa Point
(Seabeck quadrangle) and has generally northwestward net shore-drift to
the northern end of a small, unnamed bay.  Glacial drift overlays
basalt at the cell origin, where a thin, coarse-gravel beach sits atop
a wide, basalt wave-cut platform.  A wider, sand and gravel beach is
present at the head of the bay.  The cell terminates in the
northernmost part of the bay, at a zone of drift convergence in common
with cell JE-24.
