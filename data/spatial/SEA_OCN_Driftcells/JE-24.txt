(Brinnon quadrangle)

Cell JE-24 originates near the southernmost portion of the Dosewallips
River Delta and has generally northward net shore-drift for 5.2 km to
the small bay located 2 km north of Seal Rock, in western Dabob Bay.
A substantial portion of sediment from the Dosewallips River that is
deposited in the nearshore area appears to be transported northward by
net shore-drift from the currently active southeastern portion of the
delta.  This is due to the 6 km of southerly fetch that this portion of
the fan-shaped delta is exposed to, while it is mostly sheltered from
north and northeast waves.  The northern portion of the delta is
currently inactive, but is broader and has a more gradual delta front
depth gradient than that on the southeast portion of the delta.  Thus,
generally northward net shore-drift across the Dosewallips River Delta
is indicated by northward delta offset (that is roughly analogous to
northward beach width increase).

North of the Dosewallips River Delta, northward net shore-drift is
indicated by sediment accumulation on the southern side of a rip-rap
seawall and boat ramp at the town of Seal Rock, northward creek mouth
and delta offset at the Turner Creek delta, and overall northward beach
width increase and sediment size decrease.  The drift cell terminus is
located in the northernmost portion of the bay that is northwest of Wawa
Point (Seabeck quadrangle), at a zone of drift convergence in common with
cell JE-23.  Northward net shore-drift in this cell matches northward net
shore-drift in cell JE-16 in eastern Dabob Bay (Seabeck and Quilcene
quadrangles).
