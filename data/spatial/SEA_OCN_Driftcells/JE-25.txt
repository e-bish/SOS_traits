(Brinnon quadrangle)

Net shore-drift originates immediately north of the town of Brinnon and
is southeastward for 2.1 km to Pleasant Harbor in cell JE-25.  Net
shore-drift diverges between cell JE-24 and this cell at the southern
extent of the Dosewallips River Delta.  South of the delta,
northeasterly fetch becomes the factor controlling net shore-drift,
since the shore here is sheltered from southerly waves by Black Point.
Southwestward net shore-drift is evidenced by minor southwestward beach
width increase and sediment size decrease, and southwestward spit
progradation (for 150 m) at a location just inside of the narrowest
portion of the mouth of Pleasant Harbor.  The end of this spit is the
cell terminus.
