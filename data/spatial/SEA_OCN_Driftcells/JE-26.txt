(Brinnon quadrangle)

Cell JE-26 is a 0.5-km-long cell that has westward then southwestward
net shore-drift across the northern portion of Black Point and into
Pleasant Harbor.  The cell originates immediately west of a basaltic
point located on northeast Black Point.  Drift sediment is derived from
glacial drift that overlays the basalt.  Indicators of westward net
shore-drift are westward and southwestward bluff vegetation increase,
sediment size decrease, and progradation of a wide beach to a location
inside of the narrowest portion of the mouth of Pleasant Harbor,
directly across from the Pleasant Harbor Marine State Park.  Net
shore-drift in this cell matches that of cell JE-25 on the opposite
side of Pleasant Harbor.
