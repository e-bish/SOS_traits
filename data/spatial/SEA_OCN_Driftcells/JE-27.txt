(Brinnon quadrangle)

Cell JE-27 originates at the east-northeast portion of Black Point and
has generally southward net shore-drift for 2.0 km along a sinuous
shore to Quatsap Point.  This area is exposed to northerly and
northeasterly fetch, which controls net shore-drift.  Evidence of
generally southward net shore-drift is provided by an overall southward
sediment size decrease, southeastward stream mouth offset near the
center of the cell, and southeastward progradation of Quatsap Point, a
cuspate spit with a distinctly triangular plan shape.  The cell
terminus is located at Quatsap Point, which is a zone of drift
convergence between this cell and cell JE-28.
