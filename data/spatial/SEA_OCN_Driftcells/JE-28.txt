(Brinnon quadrangle)

This cell originates at the central portion of the Duckabush River Delta
and has northeastward and eastward net shore-drift for approximately 2.2
km to Quatsap Point.  (The setting of this cell is very similar to that
of cell JE-24 that has northeastward and northward net shore-drift
across most of the Dosewallips River Delta.)  Northeastward and eastward
net shore-drift are indicated by nearshore bars oriented east-west,
moving to the northeast across the delta, northeastward offset of the
main distributary channel of the Duckabush River, eastward beach width
increase along Black Point, and southeastward progradation of Quatsap
Point, a cuspate spit that is the location of the drift cell terminus.

No appreciable net shore-drift occurs along the rocky shore southwest
of the Duckabush River Delta to McDaniel Cove.  The shore here consists
of basalt with isolated beaches between rocky prominences.
