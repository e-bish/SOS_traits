(Brinnon and Holly quadrangles)

Cell JE-29 originates at the location 1.2 km northeast of the Fulton
Creek outlet (Holly quadrangle).  Net shore-drift is to the northeast
around an unnamed point (located at the division between the Holly and
Brinnon quadrangles), then to the northwest to a rip-rap jetty in
McDaniel Cove, for a total distance of 0.7 km.  Indicators of
northeastward then northwestward net shore-drift are accumulations of
sediment on the southwest side of rock outcrops partially interrupting
drift, and sediment size decrease over the length of the cell.  The
point is composed of basalt, and is not depositional.  Net shore-drift
continues around the point and terminates at the rip-rap jetty in
McDaniel Cove (Brinnon quadrangle).

No appreciable net shore-drift occurs for 0.6 km southwest of cell
JE-29 along a basaltic shore.
