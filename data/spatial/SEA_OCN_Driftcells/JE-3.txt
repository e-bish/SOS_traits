(Port Ludlow quadrangle)
Recent investigation suggests that this 300 m drift
cell is really a portion of a larger cell, comprised of it and cell JE-4 (Johannessen 1999).
  Although the poorly-vegetated headland comprised of glacial drift that is
located 1.0 km west of Olele Point contributes sediment to the cell, it is also fed by the
 drift cell JE-4.  The paucity of vegetation and steep slope of the headland
suggests that the headland is eroding and providing sediment to the shore drift
system.  A narrow beach consisting of boulders and cobbles fronts the
small headland.  Southwestward net shore-drift is evidenced by
southwestward bluff vegetation and beach width increase, and sediment
size decrease.  Southwestward net shore-drift deposits in a zone of
drift convergence in common with cell JE-2, where a relatively wide
beach consisting of cobbles, pebbles and sand is present.
