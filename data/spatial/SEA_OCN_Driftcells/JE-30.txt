(Holly quadrangle)

This cell is located in the small embayment immediately north of Triton
Cove.  Net shore-drift is northeastward for 1.7 km.  The cell
originates 100 m north of the largest rocky prominence that defines the
north end of Triton Cove, located north-northwest of Triton Head.
Northeastward net shore-drift is evidenced by northeastward stream
mouth and delta offset near the beginning of the cell, northeastward
beach width increase up to the Fulton Creek delta, northeastward
sediment size decrease, and the accumulation of sediment on the
southwest side of several rock outcrops near the cell terminus.  The
cell terminus is located 0.5 km northeast of where Fulton Creek passes
beneath highway 101.

No appreciable net shore-drift occurs along the rocky northwest shore
of Triton Cove.  The shore is composed of basalt with little beach
sediment present.  The head of Triton Cove receives sediment from a
small creek, but the wave energy present within Triton Cove is
directed into the cove, not out of it, resulting in no net shore-drift.
The Jefferson County boundary is located in southern Triton Cove.
Mason County net shore-drift mapping coverage begins at the southeast
shore of Triton Cove.
