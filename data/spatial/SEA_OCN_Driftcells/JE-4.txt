(Port Ludlow Quadrangle)

Predominant drift in this cell begins immediately west of Olele Point.
 This drift cell was previously reported to have a net eastward shore-drift
 (Johannessen 1992), but further field investigation and review of aerial
photos indicate reversals in drift and changes since the earlier work that
 suggest drift in JE-4 is actually east to west, not the otherway around. 
In this case, cell JE-4 actually just feeds JE-3 and they are really
just different portions of the same cell (Johannessen 1999 Eastern
Jefferson County Critical Marine Area Report) .  


No appreciable net shore-drift occurs between Olele Point and the
Mats Mats Quarry barge harbor (immediately south of Basalt Point)
where the coast is comprised of basalt.  The only sediment present
along this reach is found in small, isolated beaches enclosed by rocky
points.  No appreciable net shore-drift occurs within Mats Mats Bay,
as there is insufficient wave energy.
