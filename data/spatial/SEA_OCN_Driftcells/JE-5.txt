(Port Ludlow quadrangle)

This cell originates immediately south of the Mats Mats Quarry barge
harbor and has net shore-drift to the south for 4.2 km, to the marina
in Port Ludlow.  An erosional bluff cut into glacial drift present at
the origin of the cell serves as the sediment source.  Southward net
shore-drift is indicated by sediment accumulations on the north side of
rock outcrops (located west of Colvos Rocks), and southward beach width
increase and sediment size decrease.  Net shore-drift continues to an
accretionary, sandy beach at the southern end of an artificially
enlarged point that defends the marina, located south of the village of
Port Ludlow.  Net shore-drift terminates at a concrete structure on the
southwest corner of this point.

No appreciable net shore-drift occurs within Port Ludlow harbor, the
southern shore of which is composed of basalt.  Although sandy beach
occurs over parts of the harbor, low wave energy and substantial human
modification preclude net shore-drift from occurring.
