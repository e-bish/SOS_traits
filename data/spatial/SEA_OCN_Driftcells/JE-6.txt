(Port Ludlow quadrangle)

Net shore-drift in cell JE-6 originates on the west side of Tala Point
and goes southwestward for 3.4 km into Port Ludlow harbor, terminating
in southern Port Ludlow.  Tala Point is a mostly unvegetated, erosional
headland that is composed of sandy glacial drift, and shows evidence of
a recent slide.  The point is fronted by a narrow, coarse-gravel beach
with large boulders present in the nearshore area.  Southwestward net
shore-drift is indicated by southwestward beach width and bluff
vegetation increase, and sediment size decrease (beach sediment grades
into mud at the broad intertidal zone in southern Port Ludlow harbor),
southwestward offset of a stream mouth located 2.0 km southwest of Tala
Point, and nearshore bars oriented east-west, moving southward
approximately 2.5 km southwest of Tala Point.  The cell terminates at
the east side of the small, unnamed peninsula south of the marina.
