(Hansville quadrangle)

Cell JE-8 originates at southern Hood Head and has net shore-drift to
the northeast for 1.6 km to Point Hannon.  Southern Hood Head is an
erosional headland comprised of glacial drift, some of which contains
abundant sand and gravel, that is a zone of drift divergence between
this cell and cell JE-9.  It consists of a 30-m-high, poorly-vegetated
and steep bluff face.  Indicators of northeastward net shore-drift are
northeastward bluff vegetation and beach width increase, and sediment
size decrease, and progradation of the cuspate spit at Point Hannon
(see JE-7), the cell terminus.
