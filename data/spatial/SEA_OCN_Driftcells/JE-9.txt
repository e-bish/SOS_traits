(Hansville and Port Ludlow quadrangles)

Net shore-drift originates from southern Hood Head (Hansville
quadrangle) in cell JE-9, and goes to the north along eastern Bywater
Bay for 1.5 km to the head of the bay (Port Ludlow quadrangle).  The
erosional headland of southern Hood Head provides abundant drift
sediment to this short drift cell.  This is causing By water Bay to
gradually fill with sediment.  Northward net shore-drift is evidenced
by northward beach width and bluff vegetation increase, sediment size
decrease, stream mouth offset (located 150 m south of the northern end
of the bay), andaccretion of a broad, vegetated base to the south and
east portion of the berm connecting Hood Head to the mainland
(discussed in cells JE-7, Port Ludlow quadr angle), which has resulted
in a plan view shape similar to that of a cuspate spit.  Net
shore-drift terminates at the northern end of Bywater Bay at a broad
low-tide beach.
