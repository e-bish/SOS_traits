Cape Flattery quad

This drift cell originates at the south side of Koitlah Point and
terminates at the breakwater northwest of the village of Neah Bay.  Net
shore-drift to the southeast is indicated by an increase in cliff
vegetation and beach width to the southeast. There is also a decrease
in grain size to the southeast, with a relatively large accumulation of
medium to fine sand at the breakwater.


West of Koitlah Point to Mushroom Rock, the most westerly
extent of this investigation, the coast is characterized by a number of
pocket beaches between conglomerate and sandstone headlands.  Because
the northwesterly orientation of these beaches is normal to the
greatest fetch direction and there is deep water offshore, this area
has no appreciable net shore-drift.
