This segment contains the terminus of the cell that originates in the
Lyre River area (see Map JF-9, Segment 9-1) and displays an eastward
net shore-drift.  Indicators of the drift direction are a diminution in
grain size and increases in beach width and slope to the east with a
large accumulation of gravels and sands terminating in Agate Bay.
