Increases in beach width and slope to the east and the easterly
diversion of Salt Creek indicate the eastward net shore-drift within
Crescent Bay.  This cell begins at the west end of the bay and extends
to the Salt Creek mouth.  Originating south of Observatory Point, this
segment has a southeasterly net shore-drift as indicated by a reduction
in grain size and bluff slope to the southeast.  The terminus of this
cell is in the adjacent map area (see Map JF-11, Segment 11-1).
