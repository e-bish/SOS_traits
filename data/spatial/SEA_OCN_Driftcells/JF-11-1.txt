The eastward net shore-drift is indicated by a decrease in grain size
and bluff slope to the east as well as an eastward diversion of the
Elwha River.  This segment contains most of a drift cell that
originates near Observatory Point (see Map JF-10, Segment 10-3) and
terminates at the mouth of the eastern distributary of the Elwha
River.
