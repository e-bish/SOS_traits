Originating from a divergence zone at Angeles Point, this cell
terminates at the end of a spit that projects southwesterly into the
mouth of the eastern distributary of the Elwha River.  Southwesterly
net shore-drift is indicated by a decrease in grain size to the
southwest and a series of dune ridges which display the southwesterly
spit growth.  This reversal of shore drift is caused by a wave shadow
created by the outer spit at the terminus of segment 11-1, thereby
allowing only easterly or northeasterly generated waves to move
sediment.
