This segment displays a southeasterly net shore-drift.  This drift is
indicated by object interruption of sediment, decrease in grain size,
and an increase in beach width to the southeast.  Mid-sector bluff
erosion and rip-rap at the bluff base impede further development of the
latter two indicators at the eastern extreme of this segment.  The
origin of this segment is a divergence zone near Angeles Point and the
terminus is the distal end of Ediz Hook (see Map JF-12, Segment 12-1).
