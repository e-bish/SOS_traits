The easterly net shore-drift is indicated by the growth of Ediz Hook
and grain size diminution to the east.  This transport direction is
further indicated by the accumulation of sediment on the west side of
boulders (rip-rap) and drift logs with erosion on the east side.  The
origin is near Angeles Point (see Map JF-11, Segment 11-3) with the
terminus at the end of Ediz Hook.
