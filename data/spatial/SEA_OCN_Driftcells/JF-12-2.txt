This drift cell originates near the end of Ediz Hook in Port Angeles
Harbor and terminates at the Crown Zellerbach industrial structures.
Westerly net shore-drift is indicated by grain size diminution to the
west and the interruption of sediment by collapsed piers, docks, and
drift logs.  Local modifications and industrialization of the shoreline
impede the shore drift through the remainder of this map area.
