With its origin at a zone of divergence centered between Peabody and
Ennis Creeks, this cell displays a westerly net shore--drift that
terminates at the Port Angeles City Pier.  The drift direction is
indicated by an accumulation of sediment on the east side of some
boulders and of sands at the city pier.  (The small beach at the city
pier is locally known as Hollywood Beach.)
