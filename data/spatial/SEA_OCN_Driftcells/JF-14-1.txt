Diverging from drift cell 13-3, this segment has an easterly net
shore-drift that continues to the east of this map area.  Mid-sector
bluff erosion replenishes the sediment supply east of Bagley Creek and
east of Green Point. Object interruption of sediment and diversion to
the east of Morse Creek are drift indicators present.  Grain size
diminution is present in the Morse Creek and Green Point areas, but is
interrupted by the mid-sector bluff erosion.  Beaches are present at
Morse Creek and Green Point with both having developed primary dunes.
