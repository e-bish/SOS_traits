Segment 15-1 is a continuation of a drift cell which begins at a zone
of divergence west of Morse Creek and ends at the tip of Dungeness
Spit.  There is active bluff erosion throughout this segment which
obscures or prevents the development of most geomorphic indicators.
However,the build up of sediment on the southwest side of large objects
displays a northeasterly net shore-drift, thereby indicating that these
glacial bluffs are part of the feeder system to Dungeness Spit.
