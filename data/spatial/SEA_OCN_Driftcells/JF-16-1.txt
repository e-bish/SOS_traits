This segment contains Dungeness Spit, the terminus of a drift cell that
originates from a divergence zone near Morse Creek (see Map JF-14,
Segment 14-1). The total length of the cell is approximately 23 km.,
with the spit consisting of the last 9 km.  In addition to
northeasterly spit growth, a decrease in coarse sediment to the
northeast and obstacle interruption of material indicate the
northeasterly net shore-drift.
