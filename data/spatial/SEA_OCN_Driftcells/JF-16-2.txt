The origin of this cell is the bayside tip of Dungeness Spit with the
terminus on the east side of Graveyard Spit; a large, secondary spit
projecting southward into Dungeness Bay from Dungeness Spit.  The
southwesterly net shore-drift is indicated by spit formation and
reduction in grain size southwestward.
