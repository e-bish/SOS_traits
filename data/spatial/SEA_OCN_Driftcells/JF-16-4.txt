This drift cell is on the bayside of Dungeness Spit and west of
Graveyard Spit.  It has a northeasterly net shore-drift that hooks
southeasterly at the end, gradually enclosing a lagoon at the
terminus.  Sediment accumulation against drift logs and a northeasterly
diminution in grain size further indicate the drift direction.
