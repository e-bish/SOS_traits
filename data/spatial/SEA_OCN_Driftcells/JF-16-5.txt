A decrease in bluff slope and sediment size, along with the formation
of Cline Spit, indicate the northeastward net shore-drift.  The cell
originates near the western extreme of Dungeness Bay and terminates on
the west side of the tip of Cline Spit.  Interruption of sediment by a
rock groin and a boat ramp also indicate the northeasterly drift
direction.
