Originating from a zone of divergence near Kulakala Point (see Map
JF-17, Drift Cell 17-1), this cell displays a northwestward net
shore--drift that terminates on the east side of the end of Cline
Spit.  The blocking of sediment by a number of groins is evident within
this drift sector.  Other indicators of a northwestward transport
direction are the westerly offset of Dungeness River distributaries, an
increase in fine sediment toward the terminus, and the northerly growth
of Cline Spit.
