With the origin at a zone of divergence centered about Pitship Point,
Drift Cell 17-2 has a northerly net shore-drift.  It terminates at a
small spit projecting north into the lagoon on the west side of Gibson
Spit.  Decreases in bluff slope and grain size to the north, northerly
spit growth, and increasing beach width indicate the direction of
drift.
