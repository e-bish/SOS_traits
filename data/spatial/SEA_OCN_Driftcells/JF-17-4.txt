This sector contains the terminus of a cell which originates at a
divergence zone near Rocky Point (see Map JF-18, Segment 18-1).
Indicating the southwesterly net shore-drift are decreases in grain
size and bluff slope to the southwest, increases in beach width and
slope southwestward, and the growth of Travis Spit.  This segment
terminates at the end of Travis Spit.
