The origin is a divergence zone centered about 1.5 km north of Hardwick
Point and the terminus is the tip of a spit projecting northward across
the mouth of Paradise Cove.  The northerly spit growth, decreasing
grain size, and deposition of material on the south side of drift logs,
indicates the northerly net shore-drift direction.
