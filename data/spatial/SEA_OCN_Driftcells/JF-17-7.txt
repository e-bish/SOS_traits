Diverging from Drift Cell 17-6 north of Hardwick Point, this segment
contains the origin and major portion of a drift cell that terminates
in the southeast extent of Sequim Bay.  Mid-sector bluff erosion in
areas south of Hardwick and Goose Points temporarily obscures the
southeasterly decrease of grain size.  Hardwick and Goose Points are
looped bars with pro-gradation to the southeast in both cases.  Nearing
each point, the beach widens and the bluff becomes more vegetated.  The
net shore-drift of this sector is southeasterly.
