Active bluff erosion with deposition of sediment on the east side of
drift logs indicates westerly net shore-drift.  As part of the feeder
system to Travis Spit (see Map JF-17, Segment 17-4), this segment
originates at a zone of divergence near Rocky Point.  Westerly
diminution of coarse sediment becomes evident only near the western end
of this segment.
