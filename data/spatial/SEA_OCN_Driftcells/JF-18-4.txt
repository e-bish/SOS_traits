Diverging from Drift Cell 18-3, this sector culminates its easterly net
shore-drift in a convergent zone at Diamond Point.  Accumulation of
sediment on the west side of obstacles and a decrease in bluff slope
and sediment size to the east indicate the transport direction.  In
addition, beach slope and width increase toward the terminus.
