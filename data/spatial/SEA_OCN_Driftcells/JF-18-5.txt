Beginning at a divergence zone near the Clallam County line to the
south, this cell displays a northerly net shore-drift that converges
with Drift Cell 18-4 at Diamond Point.  Indicators of the drift
direction are object interruption of sediment, changing bluff
morphology from south to north, diminishing grain size, and a northerly
increase in  each width and primary dune development.
