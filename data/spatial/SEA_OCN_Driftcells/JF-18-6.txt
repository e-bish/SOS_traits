Indicators of the southerly net shore-drift are spit growth, and
decreases in sediment size and bluff slope to the south.  The terminus
of this segment is at the tip of a small spit projecting southward into
the head of Sequim Bay near Blyn.  This sector contains the terminus of
a cell that originates from a divergence zone north of Hardwick Point
(see Map JF-17, Segment 17-7).
