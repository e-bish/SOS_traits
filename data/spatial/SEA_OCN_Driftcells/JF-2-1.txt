The westerly net shore-drift of sediment through Neah Bay is indicated
by the accumulation of sediment on the east side of groins and erosion
on the west side.  Accumulation of sand on the south side of the
breakwater to Waadah Island is further indication of this westerly
transport direction.  This segment begins west of Baada Point and
terminates at the breakwater.  (Because of the changing attitude of the
Neah Bay coastline, the actual drift direction varies from
southwesterly at the east end of the bay to northwesterly at the west
end of the bay, with the overall net shore-drift being in a westerly
direction.)
