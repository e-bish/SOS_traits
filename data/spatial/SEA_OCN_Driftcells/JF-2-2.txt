This drift cell originates west of Bullman Creek where the coastline
abruptly changes from a northwesterly orientation to a westerly
orientation.  It terminates at a rock point east of the creek where the
Coastline regains its northwesterly orientation.  Indicating the
easterly net shore-drift are the approximately 200 meter easterly
diversion of the creek mouth, the diminution of active cliff erosion to
the east, and an increase in beach width near the terminus of the drift
cell.  There is no appreciable net shore-drift between Baada Point and
Drift Cell 2-2 because of the impediment to the sediment by deep water
offshore.
