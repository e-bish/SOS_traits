The easterly net shore-drift through this cell is indicated by a
diminution of grain size from coarse gravel and cobble at the origin to
gravel and coarse sand at the terminus.  Further indicating this
easterly drift is the presence of large driftwood with deposition
occurring on the west side of logs and erosion on the east side.  This
cell originates west of Rasmussen Creek and terminates at a small
promontory east of the creek.
