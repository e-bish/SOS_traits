This cell is in the area locally known as Chito Beach.  It originates
south of Shipwreck Point and terminates at a rock promontory east of
Olsen Creek.  An increase in beach width and slope occur to the
southeast as well as a decrease in grain size.  A further indication of
southeasterly net shore-drift is the interruption of sediment by a
groin constructed of large boulders.  Accumulation occurs on the
northwest side of the groin with erosion occurring for approximately
300 meters to the southeast of the groin.
