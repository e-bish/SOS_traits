Diversion of the Seiku River mouth by more than 500 meters to the
southeast is the most evident indicator of transport direction in this
segment.  Interruption of sediment movement along the beach by large
boulders and drift logs, and the diminution of grain size are further
indicators of southeasterly net shore-drift.  Originating at a headland
northwest of the Seiku River, this segment contains the updrift half of
a drift cell that continues into the adjacent map area (see map JF4,
Segment 4-1).  Much of this area is starved of sediment because of the
resistance of the cliffs to erosion and the relatively small size of
the streams.  Therefore, several areas between drift cells have no
appreciable net shore-drift as headlands and promontories occlude the
continuous drift of sediment through this map area.
