The easterly net shore-drift of this segment is indicated by the
diminution of grain size and the diversion of the Hoko River mouth by
split growth to the east.  Originating near the Seiku River see Map
JF-3, Segment 3-5), this segment terminates at the mouth of the Hoko
River where the river impinges against the resistant headland of Kydaka
Point.
