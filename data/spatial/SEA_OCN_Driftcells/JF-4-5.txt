Originating at Slip Point, this cell has a southeasterly net
shore-drift which terminates at a promontory west of the Clallam River
mouth.  Indicators of the southwesterly transport direction are
sediment interruption by drift logs, increasing beach width and
presence of fine sands to the west, and the nearly 2 kilometer
diversion of the Clallam River mouth.  This small nap area east of Slip
Point is characterized by no appreciable net shore-drift as offshore
deep water impedes the shore drift.
