With it's origin at a divergence zone to the east, this cell displays a
northwesterly net shore-drift.  Increasing beach width and slope, cliff
vegetation, and decreasing grain size to the northwest are indicators
of the northwesterly drift.  This cell terminates at a small headland
where, beyond such, deep water offshore predominates the remainder of
this map area and no appreciable net shore-drift exists.
