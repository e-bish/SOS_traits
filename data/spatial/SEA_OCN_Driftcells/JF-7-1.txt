The eastward net shore-drift of this cell is indicated by a changing
bluff morphology from west to east, increasing beach width and slope to
the east, and a large accumulation of medium to fine sand at the
terminus west of Pillar Point.  This cell originates from a divergence
zone to the west (see Map JF-6, Drift Cell 6-1).
