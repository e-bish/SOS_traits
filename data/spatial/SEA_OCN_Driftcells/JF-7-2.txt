Originating south of Pillar Point, this cell terminates at the end of a
spit which has diverted the Pysht River southward approximately 800
meters.  In addition to stream mouth diversion and spit growth, other
indicators of the southerly net shore-drift are the presence of relict
dune ridges (which display the progressing spit growth) in the
mid-interior of the spit.
