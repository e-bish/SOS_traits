This drift cell is over 4 kilometers long and extends from west of Joe
Creek to a small promontory approximately 1.5 kilometers east of Deep
Creek.  Because of the general lack of sediment, the shore drift
indicators are very subtle in this area.  However, some large boulders
and drift logs display an accumulation of material on their west
sides.  There is also a diminution in grain size from boulders and
cobbles in the western portion to cobbles, gravels, and some coarse
sands to the east, thereby indicating an eastward net shore-drift.
Deep water offshore impedes shore drift through the remainder of this
map area.  This area is characterized by very fine-grained tide flats,
wave-cut platforms, nearshore rocks, and a general absence of sediment
and high tide beaches.  Sediment from the Twin rivers is sufficient to
build high tide beaches locally, but that sediment displays normal
deltaic deposition only with no known geomorphic indicators of shore
drift present.  Therefore, this map area is classified as having no
appreciable net shore--drift.  The cause of this is wave refraction
around, and the dissipation of wave energy by, the multitudes of
nearshore rocks.
