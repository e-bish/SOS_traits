Beginning at a small headland nearly 3 kilometers west of the Lyre
River, this segment contains the origin and most of the drift cell
which terminates in Agate Bay of the adjacent map area (see Map JF--10,
Segment 10-1).  Bluff erosion is present at the origin and in
mid-sector between Field and Whiskey creeks.  In both cases, the bluff
erosion decreases and bluff vegetation increases to the east.  As
further indication of the easterly net shore-drift, there is an overall
decrease in grain size with boulders and cobbles dominant near the
origin and gravels dominant through the Whiskey Creek area.
