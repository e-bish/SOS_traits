Stuart Island quad

This is the only drift cell on Johns Island, located in the central portion of the south shore of the island.  Net shore-drift is southeastward in this cell.  The cell originates 0.7 km from the northwestern end of the island, immediately east of the end of a rocky coastal sector.  Net shore-drift continues southeastward for 1.0 km until rocky shore begins again.  The origin of the cell is located in front of erosional bluffs, composed of glacial till and outwash, that are the sediment source.  The beach here consists of pebbles and cobbles, with lesser amounts of sand and boulders.  A large number of glacial erratics are found at this northwestern end of the beach, indicating that the erosion rate of this portion of the bluff is greatest, and that net shore-drift is southeastward, away from this area.  Further evidence of southeastward net shore-drift is the increase in bluff vegetation to the southeast.  The sediment size becomes finer progressing southeast along the beach for 0.5 km, before the amount of beach sand decreases, giving way to predominantly pebbles and cobbles at the southeastern end of the beach. However, the volume of beach material increases to the southeast in the form of gravel beach ridges and a high berm, indicating that southeastward net shore-drift is occurring, despite the reverse sediment size gradation along the southeastern half of the beach (as opposed to the expected progressive sediment size decrease over the length of the cell).  The cell terminus is located against the northwestern side of a rock outcrop at the end of the beach.
