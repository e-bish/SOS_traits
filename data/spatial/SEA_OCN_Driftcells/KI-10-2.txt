Tacoma North quad

At the rounded headland immediately southwest of Dumas Bay a drift
divergence occurs along a coastal stretch dominated by sandy coastal
bluffs and a broad, sandy intertidal zone.  To the east of the headland
shore drift is responsible for deposition of an inter-tidal spit at the
change in shoreline orientation into Dumas Bay.  From this area and
south along the west side of the bay a series of well developed oblique
bars indicate southerly net shore-drift   The drift cell
terminus is a prograded beach along the west shore of the bay's
southwest corner.
