Tacoma North quad

Originating at a drift divergence at the headland south-west of Dumas
Bay, this drift cell has south to
southwesterly shore drift crossing the King-Pierce County line and
reaching a terminus at Dash Point (Pierce County).  This cell has a
broad intertidal terrace and the most striking indicator of net
shore-drift is a series of oblique bars across this terrace oriented
perpendicular to the northeasterly predominant-wave approach.  These
oblique bars (best observed on air photos) are the most extensive
series of this type of feature observed in King County. Most of this
coastal stretch is unmodified park land, but a limited number of groins
or bulkhead offsets show sediment accumulation on the northwest side.
The stream at Dash Point State Park is riprapped to preclude any
present-day offset, but the backshore is 2-3 m wider on the north
side.
