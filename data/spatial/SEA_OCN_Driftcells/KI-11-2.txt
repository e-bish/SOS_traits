Duwamish Head and Vashon quads

This cell originates at a drift divergence immediately north of Fern
Cove where the prevailing and predominant southwesterly waves overcome
a wave shadow.  Northward net shore-drift is indicated by sediment
accumulat-ing on the south sides of numerous groins between Sandy Beach
and Point Vashon, by the orientation of oblique bars at Sandy and
Sylvan Beach, and a general northward fining of sediment size.  The
drift cell terminus is a prograding beach at Point Vashon. Pebble,
granule and sand grade finer northward around the Point and onto the
clay wave-cut platform that characterizes the north shore of Vashon
Island. Some sand may seasonally be transported around the point and
become part of the easterly net shore-drift along the north shore of
the island.
