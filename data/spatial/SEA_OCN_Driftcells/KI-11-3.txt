Vashon quad

Originating at the north end of Fern Cove this cell has southerly net
shore-drift indicated by sediment grading, and accumulation on the
north sides of drift obstructions. The drift cell terminus is a sand,
granule and pebble spit that deflects a small stream southward along
the east shore of the inner cove.
