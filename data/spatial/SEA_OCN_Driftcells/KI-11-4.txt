Vashon quad

This cell with easterly net shore-drift originates at a drift
divergence approximately 0.9 km northeast of Peter Point.  The
divergence is a zone with no backshore, wave eroded bluffs, and a
coarse beach with a scatter of boulders.  To the east sediment and
driftwood stack against the west side of a bulkhead offset, an
inter-tidal fan accumulates sediment on the west side, a small stream
is offset east, and sediment on the upper foreshore generally fines to
the east.  The drift cell terminus is a mixed sand and gravel spit at
the south side of the inner cove similar to the spit on the opposite
side.
