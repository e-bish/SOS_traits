Vashon quad

This cell originates to the southwest of Fern Cove and has
southwesterly net shore-drift in response to a principle northerly
fetch. Drift direction is indicated by sediment accumulation at drift
obstructions, sediment grading, and increase in beach slope to the
drift cell terminus at Peter Point, an asymmetrical cuspate-spit with a
north shore of sand, granule and pebble.  Much of this cell receives
considerable wave energy as indicated by wave-eroded bluffs and a
lower foreshore commonly exposing a clay or till wave-cut platform.
