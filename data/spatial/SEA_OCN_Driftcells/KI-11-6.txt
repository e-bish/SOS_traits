Olalla, Vashon quads

This cell originates in a broad zone across the embayment in Section
23, about 1.2 km south-southwest of Peter Point.  The stream entering
this embayment is offset northwards and this inner embayment has
sediment grading finer from south to north. To the north a backshore
develops on the west side of the headland and the backshore widens to a
small prograded beach on the north side of the headland.  Approaching
Peter Point, the drift cell terminus, the foreshore increases in slope
and sediment fines to pebble, granule and sand.
