Olalla quad

Originating along the embayment in section 23, this cell has
southwesterly net shore-drift to a terminus at the symmetrical
cuspate-spit in section 26. Drift direction is indicated by sediment
accumulation at a boulder groin to the east of the spit, sediment
fining towards the spit, and an increase in beach slope and backshore
width.  The spit is predominantly sand, with some granule and pebble.
