Olalla quad

On the north shore of the embayment at Green Valley Creek the shore is
exposed to the prevailing and predominant south to southwest
waves.  The cell has northward net shore-drift with a terminus at a cuspate
spit 0.8 km north of Cove.  Direction of
net shore-drift is indicated by bluff morphology, sediment grading and
accumulation on the south sides of groins, several small stream
offsets, a repeating backshore widening from south to north, and a
northward increase in volume of sand across the low tide beach.

Sediment is finer around the headland at Cove. The shore immediately north of Cove
has substantial wave erosion, likely due to wave refraction around the
headland. To the north small unmapped streams are offset northward, and
sediment fines to pebble, granule and sand at the drift cell terminus
at the symmetrical cuspate-spit in Section 26.
