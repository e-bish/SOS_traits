Duwamish Head quad

This drift cell has easterly net shore-drift which terminates at 
Dolphin Point. The north shore of the island faces a northerly fetch 
of approximately 45 km and has been significantly modified by wave erosion.
All of this north
shore has an exposure of clay wave-cut platform, and where this surface
is covered it is only by a thin veneer of sand and gravel.  The drift Cell
originates near the west end of the north shore.  The clay
abrasion surface has a thin veneer of sand derived from erosion of the
uplands, or sand possibly carried around Point Vashon by strong
southwesterly waves.  No backshore is present near the drift cell
origin.  Initial indication of an easterly net shore-drift occurs at
residential bulkhead offsets just west of the ferry landing.  A boat
ramp at the ferry landing obstructs the shore drift, accumulating sand
and gravel on the west side with a vertical offset of the beach of 1
meter.  The series of beach houses east of the landing have numerous
groins, all accumulating sand and gravel on the west side.  East of the
residences the unmodified shore has a 2-3 m backshore which widens towards
the east.  Sand increases in abundance eastward across the upper foreshore,
though exposure of the clay abrasion surface is persistent.  The drift cell
terminus at Dolphin Point has an abrasion surface exposed across the north
side lower foreshore, surmounted by the steep-faced prograded beach composed
of sand, granule and pebble.
