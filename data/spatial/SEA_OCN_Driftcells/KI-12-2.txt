The origin of this drift cell is a broad zone of drift divergence at a
rounded protrusion of the coast 1.2 to 1.8 km south-southwest of
Dolphin Point.  This zone of divergence is not an excep-tionally high
wave-energy zone, and thus the drift divergence is not well defined.
North and south from this zone beach sediment generally fines, and
groins or other obstructions indicate diverging net drift directions.
At this rounded protrusion, the foreshore is a pebble-cobble armor with
limited exposures of a clay wave-cut platform.  Also, a shore structure
with massive concrete groins shows no difference in sediment
accumulation from one side to the other, as would be expected in a zone
of drift divergence.  Towards the north, residential bulkheads
consistently accumu-late sediment on the southwest side. At a coastal
structure at Cowley a 0.5 m offset of the beach profile occurs, higher
on the south. Continuing northeast the beach slope increases, the
back-shore widens, and sediment fines to a sand backshore with a
foreshore of sand, granule and pebble. The prograded beach at Dolphin
Point is the drift cell terminus.
