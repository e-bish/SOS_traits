Vashon quad

The drift cell originates about 3.5 km northwest from its terminus at
Point Beales.  The zone of drift divergence consists of a pebble and
cobble armored foreshore. The foreshore sediment fines towards the
south and east, and drift obstructions consistently show accumulation
on the northwest side.  The small stream in section 17 acts as a pebble
filter with sand and pebble on the northwest side, sand on the
southeast side.  The percentage of upper-foreshore sand generally
increases towards the southeast, but about 0.2 km southeast of the
stream the beach coarsens again due to a reduced northerly wave shadow
from Dolphin Point.  Groins at Glen Acres consistently accumulate mixed
sand and gravel on the north side.  A boulder groin along the southeast
shore at Glen Acres produces an 8 m horizontal offset, and a 3 m
vertical offset, higher and wider on the northwest side. Between Glen
Acres and Point Beales an undefended shore with eroding upland is a
major source for beach sand and gravel.  Continuing southeast sediment
fines and beach slope increases to the prograding beach at Point Beales,
the drift cell terminus.
