Vashon quad

This northerly net shore-drift cell originates at a minor
headland 1.9 km south-southwest of Point Beales.  The zone of
divergence is indicated by a low-slope, coarse beach (pebble-
cobble-boulder) with sediment fining and beach slope increasing 
north and south from this headland.  Northwest of this
headland the ruins of pilings across the foreshore inhibit net
shore-drift accumulating gravel on the southeast side. The mouth of the
two streams in Section 29 are both deflected towards the north.
Continuing northeast into Section 28 the beach sediments are generally
a pebble or cobble armor and limited clay wave cut platform, indicating
greater exposure to southerly waves.  Two boulder groins in Section 28
accumulate sand and gravel on the south side.  Northward into Section
21 the beach slope increases, the backshore widens and the beach
sediment fines.  The prograded beach of sand, granule and pebble at
Point Beales is the drift cell terminus.
