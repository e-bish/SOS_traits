Vashon quad

This cell, with northerly net shore-drift, originates north of the wave
shadow of the Dockton point.  Direction of net shore-drift is indicated
by sediment accumulation on south sides of groins, stream mouth offsets
towards the north, and sediment fining.  A prominent accumulation of
sand and granule occurs on the south side of a bulkhead offset near the
20-21 section line.  East of this section line a change in shoreline
orientation results in the development of an inter-tidal sand and
gravel spit.  Northeast of the spit, along the northwest-facing shore
of this embayment, exposures of a clay wave-cut platform suggests
intermittent strong waves crossing the harbor from the northwest.
However, net shore-drift continues north across this zone, indicated by
stream mouth offsets and drift obstructions. The drift cell terminus is
a broad zone of prograding beach along the northeast shore of the
embayment in Section 16.
