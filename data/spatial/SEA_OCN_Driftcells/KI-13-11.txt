Vashon quad

This cell originates at a zone of wave-eroded, low bluffs of till
fronted by a gravel beach with exposure of till wave-cut platform. The
coastal bluffs have a more gradual slope towards the east and beach
sediments fine.  The drift cell terminus is a prograded beach and
modified spit near the outlet of the small pond in Section 16 (Rabbs Lagoon).
