Vashon quad

Northward net shore-drift is indicated by sediment grading from a
pebble-cobble armor and till wave-cut platform at the cell origin, to
sand, granule and pebble at the bay-head beach near Portage.  Bluff
morphology, groins, and changes in beach slope support this net-drift
direction.
