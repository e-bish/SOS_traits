Vashon quad

This drift cell originates where waves from the south to southeast
attack the headland at Quartermaster.  The drift divergence zone has no
backshore, a foreshore of mixed sand and gravel with a pebble-cobble
armor, and a bluff of till undergoing active wave erosion.  Toward the
north a stream mouth is deflected northward and groins accumulate sand
and gravel on the south side.  Sediment fines towards the east around
the north shore of this embayment.  The prograded beach of sand,
granule and pebble at Portage is the drift cell terminus.  Deposition
in this zone during very recent geologic time has built the low isthmus
that now connects Vashon and Maury Island.
