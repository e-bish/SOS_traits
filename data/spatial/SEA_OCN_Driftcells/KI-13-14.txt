Vashon quad

Waves from the south-southeast that approach the headland at
Quartermaster produce net shore-drift towards the northwest, indicated
by sediment accumulation against groins.  The drift cell terminus is a
mixed sand and gravel along the northeast shore of the small embayment
in Section 17.
