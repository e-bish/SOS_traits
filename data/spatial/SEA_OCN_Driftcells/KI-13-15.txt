Vashon quad

This drift cell originates just east of the embayment at the mouth of
Judd Creek.  Southerly fetch, shoreline aspect, and a prevailing-
predominant wind access across the topographic low on the Burton
peninsula are factors responsible for an easterly net shore-drift.
Drift indicators include sediment accumulation at drift obstructions,
change in beach slope, and greater percentage of sand toward the east.
The cell terminus is along the west shore of the embayment in Section
17.
