Vashon quad

Two short drift cells occur on either side of the entrance to the
embayment at Judd Creek.  During high tide waves from the harbor
produce net shore-drift into this embayed shore.  On the north shore a
prograded beach occurs at the embayment entrance, and limited shore
drift of sand continues westward for about 100 meters.
