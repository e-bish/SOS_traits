Vashon quad

Two short drift cells occur on either side of the entrance to the
embayment at Judd Creek.  During high tide waves from the harbor
produce net shore-drift into this embayed shore.  On the south shore there is
no prograded beach like on the north shore, but westward shore drift of sand is
indicated at drift obstructions as far west as the bridge crossing, a
distance of about 200 meters.  Neither of these cells are major drift
systems.
