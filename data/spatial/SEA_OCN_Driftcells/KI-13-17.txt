Vashon quad

Southerly net shore-drift in this cell results from a principal fetch
toward the northeast. Drift direction is indicated by sediment size
aggradation and accumulation against drift obstructions. At the cell
origin south of Judd Creek the foreshore is sand to cobble in size. Net
shore-drift is directed southward past the marina pier to a terminus at
a low wave-energy zone of muddy sand along the south shore inner
embayment.
