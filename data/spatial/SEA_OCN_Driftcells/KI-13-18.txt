Vashon quad

The northeast shore of the Burton Peninsula is a zone of drift
divergence due to a northeast fetch across Quartermaster Harbor and
exposure to northeast winds crossing the topographic low at Portage.
This cell has westerly net shore-drift indicated by sediment
accumulation against groins or bulkhead offsets and two lobate
intertidal spits where the shoreline has abrupt change of aspect
towards the south.  The drift cell terminus is a muddy-sand spit and
prograding beach along the south shore of the inner embayment.
