Vashon quad

Southeasterly net shore-drift results from a principal northeast
fetch.  Drift direction is indicated by sediment accumulation against
the northwest side of drift obstructions and increase in beach slope.
The drift cell terminus is the sand, granule and pebble symmetrical
cuspate-spit on the east shore of the Burton peninsula.
