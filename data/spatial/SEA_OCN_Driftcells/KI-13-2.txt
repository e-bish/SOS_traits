Vashon quad

Originating at the minor headland at section 29 this cell has southerly
net shore-drift initially indicated by north-side sediment accumulation
at groins or bulkhead offsets.  Along the northern half of section 32 a
prominent series of oblique bars indicate southerly drift.  At Klahanie
similar oblique bars occur, and bulkhead offsets accumulate sand and
gravel on the north. Net shore-drift continues southerly to where an
abrupt change in aspect of the upland has resulted in the drift-aligned
prograded beach at Point Heyer.  This point is a large recurved spit
with the shore drift influenced by refracting northerly waves and waves
ap-proaching from the south crossing Tramp Harbor. Sediment fines
westward along the south shore to a well-sorted sand along the east
side of the marsh inlet, which marks the drift cell terminus.
