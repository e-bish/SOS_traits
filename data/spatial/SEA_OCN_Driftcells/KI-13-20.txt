Tacoma North, Vashon quads

This drift cell, which dominates most of the west shore of
Quartermaster Harbor, originates at Neill Point where a drift
divergence faces a principal southeast fetch towards Commencement Bay
(Pierce County).  Neill Point is a zone of active wave erosion and
land-slides.  The foreshore is composed of mixed sand and gravel and
exposed clay wave-cut platform.

Northerly net shore-drift is initially indicated near triangulation
station MARTIN with sediment accumulated on the south side of drift
obstructions. Northward to Magnolia Beach net shore-drift is indicated
at groins, offsets of stream mouths, by backshore widening, and bluff
morphology.  An impres-sive indicator along most of this stretch is a
series of oblique bars across the low-tide beach.  Net shore-drift is
continuous eastward along the crescent-shaped beach to the Burton
peninsula.  A prominent recurved spit at the southeast shore of the
peninsula is a preliminary terminus of the drift cell depositing sand,
granule and pebble.  Limited net shore-drift continues northeast to an
ultimate drift cell terminus at the symmetrical cuspate-spit which is
the eastern-most point of the Burton peninsula.
