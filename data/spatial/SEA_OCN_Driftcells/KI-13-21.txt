Gig Harbor, Tacoma North quads

Influenced by a principal fetch towards the southeast, this cell has
westerly net shore-drift originating at Neill Point and terminating
along a modified bay-head beach at the embankment at Tahlequah Creek.
Drift indicators include bluff morphology, sediment accumulation
against the east side of groins or obstructions, and an increase in
beach slope from east to west.
