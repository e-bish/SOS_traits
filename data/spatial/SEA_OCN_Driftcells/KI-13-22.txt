Gig Harbor quad

Net shore-drift is produced by southwesterly approaching waves from the
vicinity of Tacoma Narrows (Pierce County).  The cell origin is a broad
zone of divergence along a wave-straightened coastal bluff northwest of
Point Dalco.  Groins, sediment grading and sorting indicate an easterly
net shore-drift.  The drift cell terminus is the modified bay-head
beach at the embayment at Tahlequah Creek.
