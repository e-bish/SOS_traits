Olalla, Gig Harbor quads

Unless precluded by shoreline orientation or wind and wave shadows, the
net shore-drift along the west shore of Vashon Island is generally
towards the north in response to prevailing and predominant south to
southwest wind-generated waves.  This drift Cell has northerly net
shore-drift originating southeast of Spring Beach and continuing
northward around Paradise Cove to a drift cell terminus at Sandford
Point.  Drift indicators include south-side sediment accumulation at
groins, small stream offsets, sediment grading, and bluff morphology.
The drift cell terminus begins at a granule and pebble prograded beach
near the navigational light south of Sandford Point.  A limited volume
of sand reaches an ultimate drift terminus at the broad sand beach at
Sandford Point.
