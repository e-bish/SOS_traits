Olalla quad

Immediately north of Sandford Point the shore is exposed to a northerly
fetch and resulting net shore-drift towards the south.  This drift cell
originates about 400 meters north of Sandford Point at a drift
divergence having a foreshore of pebble, cobble and a clay wave-cut
platform.  Significant bluff erosion is evident from this zone
continuing south towards Sandford Point, where the drift cell
terminates in a broad sand beach.
