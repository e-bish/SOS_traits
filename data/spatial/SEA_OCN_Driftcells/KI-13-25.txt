Olalla quad

This cell is a short drift reversal due to the shore of Christianson
Cove being protected from northerly waves.  Waves from the
west-southwest produce a northward net shore-drift.  The cell
origi-nates at a zone of gravel and exposed clay wave-cut platform.
Sediment size decreases north and into the cove.  A sand and granule
prograded beach is developed on the south side of the stream entering
the cove.  Net shore-drift continues around the cove with the north
shore, having greater wave exposure, grading from cobble and pebble at
the east to sand and pebble to the west.  The drift cell terminus is a
sand and granule beach in the wave shadow of the prograded beach at
Lisabeula (terminus of the drift Cell immediatgely to the north).
