Olalla quad

Due to shoreline orientation and principal fetch this cell has
southerly net shore-drift.  The cell originates at a drift divergence
100-300 meters south of Green Valley Creek.  Active bluff erosion is
present along most of the cell length.  Sediment grades from an upper
foreshore of cobble and exposed clay wave-cut platform, to the pebble,
granule and sand prograded beach at Lisabeula.  Waves refract around
this beach to a drift cell terminus on the north shore of Christianson
Cove.
