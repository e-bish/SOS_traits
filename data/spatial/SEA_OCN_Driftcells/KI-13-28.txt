On the north shore of the embayment at Green Valley Creek the shore is
once again exposed to the prevailing and predominant south to southwest
waves.  This segment includes the origin and the southern part of a
drift cell with northward net snore-drift and a termi-nus at a cuspate
spit 0.8 km north of Cove (see Map KI-11, Segment 11-8).  Direction of
net shore-drift is indicated by bluff morphology, sediment grading and
accumu-la-tion on the south sides of groins, several small stream
offsets, a repeating backshore widening from south to north, and a
northward increase in volume of sand across the low tide beach.
