Vashon quad

Influenced by waves from the south across Tramp Harbor, the drift cell
begins with a foreshore pebble-cobble armor and limited exposure of a
till wave-cut platform.  Towards the northeast a narrow backshore
develops and foreshore sediment fines to sand, granule and pebble.  The
drift cell terminus is the west shore of the Point Heyer marsh inlet.
