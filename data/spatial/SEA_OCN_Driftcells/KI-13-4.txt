Vashon quad

The drift cell begins at a drift divergence having a foreshore
pebble-cobble armor and limited exposures of a till wave-cut platform.
Towards the southwest sediment accumulates against the north-east sides
of groins and bulkhead offsets, beach slope increases, a backshore
develops and widens, and foreshore sediment fines to sand with granule
and pebble.  The drift cell terminus is a small bay-head beach on the
west shore of Tramp Harbor.
