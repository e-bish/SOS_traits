This segment is the beginning and west part of a drift cell that has
easterly net shore-drift along the entire north shore of Maury Island.
The drift cell terminus is at Robinson Point (see Map KI-14, Segment
14-1).  South of the drift divergence, the direction of net shore-drift
is indicated by sediment accumulation against several boulder groins,
against offsets of riprap, and against ruins of a former pier.  Just
east of Portage riprap shore defense ends on the west side of a
prominent, near-vertical exposure of a sand and gravel bluff.  Active
wave attack is evident, and this area is clearly a major source of
sedi-ment for shore drift.  Towards the east sand is more abundant on
the low tide terrace, and also in the upper foreshore.  A backshore
develops and widens toward the east.  Beginning about 1 km west of Fern
Heath a clay wave-cut platform is exposed along the lower foreshore,
indicating erosion due to this shore's northerly fetch.  Various
obstructions to drift indi-cate continued easterly net shore-drift into
the area shown on Map KI-14.
