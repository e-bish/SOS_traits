Tacoma North quad

This cell has a northerly net shore-drift from the south shore of Maury
Island into Quartermaster Harbor.  Direction of net shore-drift is
initially observed west of the drift divergence where sediment
accumulates against the southeast sides of groins at Rosehilla and
Manzanita.  A series of oblique bars at Manzanita also indicate
northerly net shore-drift.  Between Manzanita and Dockton the
prevailing and predominant southerly waves that enter Quartermaster
Harbor produce a northward drift indicated by accumulation at groins,
and the orientation of oblique bars.  The headland at Dockton is a
prograded beach of sand, granule and pebble.  However, this is not the
drift cell terminus since limited fetch and shoreline aspect preclude
any drift convergence at the point.  Waves from the south refract
around the headland, indicated by sediment fining around the point and
towards the southeast.  There is also an intertidal spit at the point
that is recurved towards the east, indicating the refracting wave
pattern.  The minor volume of sediment that is transported
around the Dockton headland reaches a drift cell terminus along a
modified bay-head beach about 0.7 km to the southeast.
