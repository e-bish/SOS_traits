Tacoma North quad

This cell is in a shadow from the local prevailing and predominant
southerly waves.  South of the drift divergence the southerly net
shore-drift is indicated by accumulation of sediment against the north
side of groins or other drift obstructions.  This embayment is a low
energy zone indicated by abundance of muddy sand across the
fore-shore.  The drift cell terminus is a modified prograded beach
along the south shore of the embayment.
