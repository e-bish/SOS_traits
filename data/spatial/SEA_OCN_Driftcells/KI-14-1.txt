Vashon, Des Moines quads

This drift cell has easterly net shore-drift along the entire north 
shore of Maury Island, with a terminus at Robinson Point.  

South of the drift divergence, the direction of net shore-drift
is indicated by sediment accumulation against several boulder groins,
against offsets of riprap, and against ruins of a former pier.  Just
east of Portage riprap shore defense ends on the west side of a
prominent, near-vertical exposure of a sand and gravel bluff.  Active
wave attack is evident, and this area is clearly a major source of
sediment for shore drift.  Towards the east sand is more abundant on
the low tide terrace, and also in the upper foreshore.  A backshore
develops and widens toward the east.  Beginning about 1 km west of Fern
Heath a clay wave-cut platform is exposed along the lower foreshore,
indicating erosion due to this shore's northerly fetch.  Various
obstructions to drift indicate continued easterly net shore-drift.

Near the section line west of Fern Heath a boulder groin has
sand, granule and pebble piled on the west side.  East and west of Fern
Heath lower-foreshore exposures of a clay wave-cut platform indicate
occasional strong wave attack due to the substantial northerly fetch.
At the triangulation station in Section 15 a boulder groin
accumulates sand and gravel on the west side, with similar
accumulation on the northwest sides of groins at Luena Beach.  Eroding
bluffs to the southeast of Luena Beach are a major source of beach
sand and gravel. The beach slope steepens towards the east, and the
backshore widens onto the prograding beach at Robinson Point, the
drift cell terminus.
