Shilshole Bay quad

Along the coast immediately south of the Shilshole Bay Moorage recent
and ongoing shoreline modifications preclude any long-term drift
indicators.  However, a southward drift direction would be predicted
based on available fetch.  Distinct evidence of southward shore drift
begins at a series of groins along residences at the entrance to Salmon
Bay, with a groin at the Viking Apartments (5701 Seaview Ave. NW)
producing a maximum 1.5 m vertical offset of the sand and pebble
beach, higher on the north side.  As the shoreline turns
towards the east sediment fines to predominantly sand. A significant
decrease in sand volume to the east suggests that sediment is lost into
the dredged channel of Salmon Bay.
