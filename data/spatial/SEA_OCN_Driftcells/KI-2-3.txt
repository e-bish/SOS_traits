Shilshole Bay quad

A drift cell along the south shore of the Salmon Bay entrance
originates at a broad zone of drift divergence along the north shore of
Magnolia Bluff at section 10.  Net shore-drift from this
divergence to the south and east is indicated by the consistent
accumulation of predominantly sand-size sediment against the north or
west sides of groins or drift obstructions.  The south column
supporting the Burlington Northern Salmon Bay bridge forms a major
obstacle to easterly drift and accumulates sediment on the west side.
Shore drift that bypasses the column reaches a drift terminus against
the west wall of the south shore visitors walkway at the H. M.
Chittenden Locks.  As with the shore drift on the north side of the
bay, sediment may be lost into the dredged channel of Salmon Bay.
