This segment originates at the drift divergence zone along the north
shore of Magnolia Bluff (Fig. 4).  Net shore-drift directed south and
west is indicated by a gradual increase in beach slope south-west from
the divergence, as well as several groins or drift obstructions
accumulating sediment on the north or northeasterly side. A major
sedi-ment accumulation occurs on the northeast side of a riprapped
landfill at the northeast shore of Section 9.  A change in shoreline
aspect towards the south has resulted in a drift-aligned, sand and
gravel intertidal spit oriented towards the southwest.  Shore drift
continues south and west at the base of a riprapped shore. The terminus
of this drift cell is the symmetrical cuspate spit which is West Point,
shown on Map KI-3.
