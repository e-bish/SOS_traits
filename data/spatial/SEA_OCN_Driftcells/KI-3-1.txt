Shilshole Bay quad

This drift cell originates at the drift divergence zone along the north
shore of Magnolia Bluff.  Net shore-drift directed south and
west is indicated by a gradual increase in beach slope south-west from
the divergence, as well as several groins or drift obstructions
accumulating sediment on the north or northeasterly side. A major
sediment accumulation occurs on the northeast side of a riprapped
landfill at the northeast shore of Section 9.  A change in shoreline
aspect towards the south has resulted in a drift-aligned, sand and
gravel intertidal spit oriented towards the southwest.  Shore drift
continues south and west at the base of a riprapped shore. 

Westerly drift along the north shore is evidenced by sediment grading westerly
from pebble to well sorted sand, an increase in beach slope towards the
west, and the general geomorphology of this shoreform.  At the western
extreme of the north shore, a beach of cobble and pebble is a recent
artificial modification for shore defense.

The drift cell terminus is along the north shore of West Point, a large symmetrical
cuspate spit formed by the convergence of two drift cells.
