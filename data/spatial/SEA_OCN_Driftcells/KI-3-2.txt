Shilshole Bay quad

Net shore-drift along the southwest shore of Magnolia Bluff is
dominated by westerly drift converging with shore drift from the
northwest side of Magnolia Bluff, thus forming the cuspate spit at West
Point. Origin of the southwest Magnolia drift cell is at a zone of
substan-tial bluff erosion and a foreshore of gravel and exposed clay
wave-cut platform at Section 25, about 0.6 km west of Port of Seattle
Pier 91.  From the zone of divergence westerly shore drift is indicated
by a decreasing gradation in mean sediment size, and accumulation of
sediment on the east side of groins and other drift obstructions.  A
prominent accumulation occurs on the east side of a riprap defense for
a storm-sewer outfall built across the upper foreshore at the foot of
32nd Avenue West.  The structure produces a 1 to 1.5 m vertical offset
of the beach profile, and acts as an effective sediment filter,
trapping cobble and pebble on the east side and allowing the bypass of
granule and sand. From this structure westward, drift is indicated
by sediment accumulation on the east sides of groins and bulkhead
offsets. Mean sediment size generally decreases towards West Point,
however, the foreshore along the south side of West Point has recently
been modified with pebble and cobble for shore defense.
