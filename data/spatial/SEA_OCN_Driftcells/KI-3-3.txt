Shilshole Bay quad

From the zone of drift divergence on the southeast shore of Magnolia
Bluff, a drift sector of about 0.8 km length is directed eastward
along the riprap shore of Smith Cove Park, building an intertidal sand
and gravel spit where the shoreline abruptly turns north into the Pier
91 slip.  Sand, granule, and pebble com-prise the shore drift
into the north end of this slip, with the drift cell terminus against
the west side of Pier 91. This is a filled structure and an absolute
barrier to shore drift.

The shore east of Pier 90 is riprapped and filled into deep water. No
appreciable net shore-drift occurs in this area.
