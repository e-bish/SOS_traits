Shilshole Bay, Seattle South, Duwamish Head quads

All of the coastal zone in this cell has been significantly
modified from a once natural setting as the result of extensive
filling, dredging and hillside regrading.  The shore of Elliot Bay has
mostly been filled in, eliminating any intertidal beach.  Water depth
and the obstruction of piers precludes any significant longshore
transport.  At present the only source of sediment for shore drift is
erosion of undefended fill material.  Because of these conditions this
entire coastal strip has no appreciable net
shore-drift.  At a small embayment in the riprap at Myrtle Edwards Park
(southwest of the Seattle Center) a sand and pebble beach has sediment
grading finer from south-east to northwest, which would represent the
drift direction along the northeast shore of Elliot Bay if a sediment
supply and unmodified conditions prevailed.
