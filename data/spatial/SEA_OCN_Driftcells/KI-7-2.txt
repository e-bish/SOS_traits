Des Moines, Vashon quads

This drift cell originates at a zone of drift divergence about 1 km
north of Secoma Beach and has a terminus at Point Pulley (also called
Three Tree Point).  The south and westerly net shore-drift is in
response to northwesterly wind-generated waves.  The major part of the
coastal appendage at Point Pulley is a topographic high that shields
the area of this drift cell from the south to southwest wind-generated
waves that produce much of the net shore-drift along the King County
mainland coast.  The direction of net shore-drift is indicated by a
general decrease of mean sediment size along the backshore on the north
side of the point, accumulation of sediment on the north or northeast
side of a limited number of groins or bulkhead offsets, and an increase
in mean beach slope from 10 percent in the small embayment northeast of
the point to 15 percent approaching the point.
