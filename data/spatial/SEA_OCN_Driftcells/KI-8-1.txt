Vashon, Des Moines quads

This became a distinct drift cell with construction of the breakwater 
at the Des Moines Moorage. The breakwater has interrupted the northward 
net shore-drift that otherwise would have been continuous through the
coastal stretch originating just south of Saltwater State Park.  

Waves from the south to southwest diffract around the
north end of the breakwater and impinge on an undefended coastal bluff
on the north side of the valley at Covenant Beach Camp.  A drift sector
originates along this zone with northward net shore-drift proceeding
under the influence of south to southwesterly waves. Evidence of
northward net shore-drift includes sediment accumulation on the south
side of bulkheads and groins, and a consistent northward offset of
small stream mouths.  At the change in shoreline aspect about 1.8 km
northwest of Covenant Beach Camp there is a graduation of mean sediment
size decreasing to the north.  

Drift direction in the northern stretch of this cell is indicated by a 
prominent westward offset of the stream mouth in Section 35.  
To the west, at a distance of 0,5 and 1.0
km, groins accumulate sand and gravel on the east side.  Mean beach
slope increases westward to Point Pulley with a grade of 6 percent 1 km
east of the point, increasing to 15 percent approaching the point.

Net shore-drift continues northwest with the drift cell terminus at Point
Pulley (also called Three Tree Point).
