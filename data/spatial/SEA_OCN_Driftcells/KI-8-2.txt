Des Moines quad

This short drift cell, resulting from the wave shadow of the Des Moines
Moorage, has net shore-drift southward terminating against the
north-facing riprap of the moorage facility. This southward net
shore-drift can be attributed to southwesterly waves diffracting around
the breakwater, the influence of northwesterly waves, or both factors.
The stream that enters this drift sector has a large intertidal fan
and the major distributary crossing this fan has been deflected
southward.  Shore drift has directed this distributary towards
the entrance of the moorage and, eventually, sufficient sediment may be
transported to reduce the entrance channel depth.
