Des Moines, Poverty Bay quads

Beginning at a zone of drift divergence about 100 meters south of
Saltwater State Park, this segment has northerly net shore drift.  
Sediment grades finer northward from
the drift divergence zone; at a line of boulders across the foreshore
marking the south park boundary, a filtering effect occurs with cobble
and pebble on the south side, and granule and sand on the north side.
Riprap stabilizing the park's stream outlet precludes any present- day
offset of the stream mouth.  The intertidal fan seaward of the park is
asymmetrical due to shore drift accretion on the south side.

North of the state park, Northward net shore-drift is indicated by 
distribution of a dark, angular rock used as fill
material along the park's north waterfront. This fill area acts as a
sediment point source with the tracer rock dispersed northward.  From
the state park sediment grades northward from mixed sand and gravel to
a greater percentage of coarse sand.  The drift cell terminus is a
large prograding beach built against riprap that protects the outfall
of a small stream paralleling the south breakwater of the Des Moines
Moorage.  Prior to construction of this moorage facility net
shore-drift was continuous northward to Point Pulley.
