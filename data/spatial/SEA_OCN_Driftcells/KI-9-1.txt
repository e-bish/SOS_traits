Beginning at a zone of drift divergence about 100 meters south of
Saltwater State Park this segment has northerly net shore drift into
the coastal stretch shown on Map KI-8 and a drift sector immediately
south of the  Des Moines Moorage.  Sediment grades finer northward from
the drift divergence zone; at a line of boulders across the foreshore
marking the south park boundary, a filtering effect occurs with cobble
and pebble on the south side, and granule and sand on the north side.
Riprap stabilizing the park's stream outlet precludes any present- day
offset of the stream mouth.  The intertidal fan seaward of the park is
asymmetrical due to shore drift accretion on the south side.
