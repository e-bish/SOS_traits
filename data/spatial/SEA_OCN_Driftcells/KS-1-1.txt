Port Gamble and Hansville quads

This cell originates in a zone of divergence approximately a mile 
south of Eglon and displays a northerly net shore-drift to its 
terminus at Point No Point.  Net shore-drift to the north
is indicated by several groins and other drift obstructions with
sediment accumulation on the south side, a gradual increase in beach
width, bluff slope decrease and a decrease in beach sediment size to the 
north. At the Eglon boat landing there is a 70 meter stream diver-sion to
the north. This drift cell terminates along the east shore of Point No Point 
which is an accumulation landform known as a cuspate spit.  A cuspate spit 
is typical of a point of convergence between two drift cells.
