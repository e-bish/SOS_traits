Hansville quad

This drift cell originates in a small zone of divergence at
Foulweather Bluff and terminates along the northwest shore of Point No
Point.  Net shore-drift in an easterly direction is demonstrated by
sediment accumulation on the west side of numerous groins and other
drift obstructions, as well as sediment size becoming finer and beach
width increasing to the east.  Bluff morphology may also indicate the
direction of net shore-drift in the following manner:  at or near the
point of origin the bluff will be steepest, with little or no
vegetation on the bluff-face, and no upper-foreshore berm is present.
Progressing toward the terminus of the drift cell the bluff becomes
less steep, and more heavily vegetated, and there may be a
well-developed upper-foreshore berm.  In Drift Cell 1-2 this cycle is
repeated twice, indicating net shore-drift to the east.  The high
bluff at Foulweather Bluff evolves into low-lying backshore in Section
7 in Skunk Bay.  The high bluff in Sections 18 and 17 in Skunk Bay
evolves into a low-lying backshore at Norwegian Point that continues
to Point No Point.
