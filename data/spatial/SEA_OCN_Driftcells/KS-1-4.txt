Hansville quad

Originating at a zone of divergence located about 0.8 km north of Coon
Bay (also called Shelter Bay) and ending along the south shore of the
accretionary landform, this drift cell exhibits a northerly net
shore-drift. The drift direction is indicated by decreasing bluff
slope, generally increasing beach width, and decreasing sediment size
in a northerly direction.  The southernmost of the two projections into
the Hood Canal is not a spit.  It is a beach with sediment moving north
around a glacial headland.
