Hansville quad

Net shore-drift is to the south in this drift cell, beginning in the
divergence zone 0.8 km north of Coon Bay and ending along the northern
sand spit enclosing Coon Bay.  Groins and other drift obstructions have
an accumula-tion of sediment on the north side.  Also, beach width
increases and sediment size decreases to the south.
