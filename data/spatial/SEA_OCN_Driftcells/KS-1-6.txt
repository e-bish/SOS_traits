Hansville quad


This drift cell originates in a zone of divergence located in Section
32 just south of the mapped rock symbol and ends along the southern
spit enclosing Coon Bay.  Net shore-drift to the north is indicated by
decreas-ing bluff slope, decreasing beach sediment size, and increasing
beach width to the north.  Then, too, approximately 1.0 km south of
Coon Bay there is a significant stream diversion to the north.
