Edmonds West quad

Originating about 0.5 km southwest of Point Jefferson, this drift 
cell ends in Appletree Cove.  This segment has a northward net shore-
drift indicated by sediment generally decreasing in size, and beach 
width generally increasing, to the north.  A point to notice is that 
the wider sand beaches in this segment form along coastal segments 
lying more or less normal to the southern wind-waves, indicating that
the highest energy waves must approach from a southerly. This observation
is in agreement with long-term wind observations which show that the
predominant winds are from the south and southwest.  President Point is 
an accumulation landform that has formed in the lee of the headland to
the south in response to the change in coastal orientation at this point.  
Pebbles and sand on the east shore grade into sand and shell fragments along
the north shore of President Point.  This and the marked asymmetry of
President Point indicates a net transport of sediment to the north
past this point.  Several groins and other drift obstacles have an
accumulation of sediment on the south and east sides. Sediment size
generally decreases to the north.  This Drift Cell ends along the
north-central shore of Appletree Cove in the vicinity of a sand spit
building toward the northwest.
