Edmonds West quad

Originating in a zone of divergence cen-tered about 0.8 km north of
Kingston and ending at Apple Cove Point, this drift cell displays a
northward net shore-drift direction.  This drift direction is indicated
by sediment decreasing in size from boulders and cobbles in the south
to granules and sand in the north, and beach width increasing to the
north.
