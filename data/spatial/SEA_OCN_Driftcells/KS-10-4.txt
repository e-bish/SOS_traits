Edmonds West quad

This drift cell originates in a divergence zone centered in Section 11
and ends at Apple Cove Point.  Net shore-drift to the south is
indicated by decreasing bluff slope, decreasing sediment size, and
increasing beach width to the south.  Apple Cove Point represents a
zone of drift conver-gence and, therefore, is an accumulation
landform.
