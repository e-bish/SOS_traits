Suquamish quad

This drift cell originate at a zone of divergence at Point Bolin. 
Point Bolin is a spectacular example of a drift divergence zone 
because of the heavy wave erosion taking place there.
Net shore-drift to the north along this segment is indicated by 
numerous groins and bulk-heads with sediment accumulated on the south.  
This drift cell ends along the south entrance to Miller Bay, where 
a small spit is building to the north.
