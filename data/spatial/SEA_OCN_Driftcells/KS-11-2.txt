Suquamish and Shilshole Bay quads

This drift cell begins in a divergence zone approximately 0.5 km south
of Point Jefferson and ends at the entrance to Miller Bay.  From east
to west the mean sediment size decreases from boulders and cobbles to a
fine-grained sand, and beach width gradually increases.  At Indianola
several groins display sediment accumulation on the east side.  These
indicators show that net shore-drift is to the west within the drift
cell.
