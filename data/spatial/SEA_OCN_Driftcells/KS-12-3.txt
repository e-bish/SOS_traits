Poulsbo quad

Beginning on the east side of Virginia Point and wrapping around the
north end, this drift cell ends along the south-westerly trending sand
spit on the west side of Virginia Point.  The net shore-drift direction
of this drift cell is shaped under the influence of several fetches.
The drift direction is indicated by slightly increasing beach width to
the north on the east side, a bulk-head and other drift obstructions on
the west shore showing sediment accumulation on the north side, and a
southwesterly trending spit at the drift cell terminus on the west
side.
