Poulsbo quad

This drift cell originates in a zone of divergence on Pearson Point and
terminates along the east side of Pearson Point.  Net shore-drift to
the south is indicated by a groin and bulkheads that have a sediment
accumula-tion on the north side and a lobate spit building to the
southeast at the terminus.
