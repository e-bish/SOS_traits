Poulsbo quad

Originating in a divergence zone at Pearson Point and terminating along
the west side of the same promontory, this drift cell displays a
southward net shore-drift.  The drift direction is in-dicated by
bulkheads and other drift obstructions showing sediment accumulation on
the north side.
