Poulsbo quad


Beginning at a zone of divergence at Scandia, this drift cell displays
a northward net shore-drift and terminates near the head of Liberty
Bay.  The drift direction is indicated by groins and other drift
obstructions with sediment accumulated on the south side, increasing
beach width and decreasing sediment size to the north.
