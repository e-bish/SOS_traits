Poulsbo quad


Section 26 on the north side of Liberty Bay contains the zone of drift
divergence in which this drift cell begins.  It displays a northward
net shore-drift and terminates in the vicinity of the marina breakwater
at Poulsbo.  This drift direction is indicated by several groins
showing sediment accumulation on the southeast side and a general
decrease in sediment size to the north.
