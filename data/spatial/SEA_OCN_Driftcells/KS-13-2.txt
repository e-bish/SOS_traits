Suquamish quad

This drift cell toriginates at a zone of divergence in Section 5
and ends along the north shore of Manzanita Bay.  In this
short cell, net shore-drift to the south is indicated by sediment
size decreasing, beach width increasing to the south, sediment
accumulation on the north side of groins and other drift obstructions
and a smale lobate sand spit building to the east.
