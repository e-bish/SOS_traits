Suquamish quad

This drift cell begins in a zone of drift divergence centered at a
survey marker in the southern part of Section 4 and ends about 0.3 km
to the west of Agate Point.  Northward net shore-drift is indicated by
the presence of several groins and other drift obstacles with sediment
accumulated on the south side.
