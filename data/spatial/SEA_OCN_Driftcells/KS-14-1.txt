Suquamish quad

This drift cell originates about 0.5 km south of Skiff Point in a
zone of divergence immediately south and terminates along the Point
Monroe spit. Net shore-drift to the north is indicated by numerous 
groins and other drift obstructions with sediment accumulated on 
the south side, increasing beach width northward, and decreasing 
sediment size to the north.
 
Northward net shore-drift is indicated by a stone groin
showing sediment accumulation on the south side, a stream diversion to
the north in section 2, beach width increasing to the north, and
sediment size decreasing northward.
