Suquamish quad


This drift cell originates in a divergence zone on the headland to the
west of Point Monroe, in Section 34.  It displays an eastward net
shore-drift toward the vicinity of the distal end of the Point Monroe
spit.  This eastward drift direction is indicated by a concrete boat
ramp showing significant sediment accumulation on the west side and
beach sediment decreasing in mean size to the east.
