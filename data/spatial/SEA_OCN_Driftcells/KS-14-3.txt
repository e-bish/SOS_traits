Suquamish quad

Beginning in a zone of drift divergence centered at the headland to the
west of Point Monroe in Section 34 and ending about 1.0 km to the south
in an unnamed embayment where it fades into sandy mud, this drift cell
displays a southward net shore-drift.  This drift direction is
indicated by several groins showing sediment accumulation on the north
side as well as sediment size decreasing to the south into the
embayment.
