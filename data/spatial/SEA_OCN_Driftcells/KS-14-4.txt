Suquamish quad

This drift cell originates approximately 0.7 km east of Agate Point and
terminates along the east shore in Section 34.  Southeast-ward net
shore-drift is indicated by groins and bulkheads with sediment
accumulated on the northwest side, and sediment grading in size from
cobble and pebbles in the west to predominantly sand and occasion-al
pebbles in the east.
