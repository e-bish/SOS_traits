Suquamish quad

This drift cell begins in a zone of drift divergence located approximately
0.5 km east of Agate Point and terminates at the sand spit immediately west
of Agate Point. Northwesterly net shore-drift is indicated by decreasing 
sediment size, increasing beach width to the northwest and a large tree 
lying across the beach about 0.2 km east of Agate Point showing sediment
accumulation on the east side. At Agate Point there are two large
boulders lying on the beach face (one with survey marker embedded in
it) showing significant sediment accumulation on the east side.
