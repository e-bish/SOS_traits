Suquamish quad


This drift cell begins in a divergence zone centered at the pilings 
0.8 km north of Gilberton, and displays southward net shore-drift
ending approximately 0.5 km south of Gilberton.  This drift direction
is indicated by several groins and bulkheads showing sediment accumulation
on the south side, beach width increasing to the south, and a southward 
decrease in sediment size.
