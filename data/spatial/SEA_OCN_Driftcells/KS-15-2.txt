Suquamish quad


This drift cell begins at a zone of divergence centered at the pilings
0.7 km south of Burke Bay, and ends at Burke Bay.  Net shore-drift to
the north is indicated by a large runoff pipe that has a significant
sediment accumulation on the south side, and a sand spit built to the
north at the driftcell terminus.  This spit has been modified for use
as a roadbed, however it still exhibits the sedi-ment accumu-lation at
its distal end charac-teristic of an active spit.
