Suquamish quad


This extremely short drift cell originates to the immediate west of the
marina 0.5 km south of Brownsville and terminates at Burke Bay,
displaying net shore-drift to the west.  The drift direction is
indicated by significant sediment accumulation on the east side of a
boat ramp and a stream outfall.  This drift cell owes its existence to
the presence of the marina and its effect on wind-wave patterns
entering this reentrant.
