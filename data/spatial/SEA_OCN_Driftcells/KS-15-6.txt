Suquamish quad

This very short drift cell originates at a zone of divergence located
on the east side of Manzanita Bay and ends 0.1 km to the east of the
same arm.  Eastward net shore-drift is indicated by bulk-heads showing
sediment accumulation on the west side, and a decrease in sediment size
to the east.
