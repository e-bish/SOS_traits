Suquamish quad

Beginning at a zone of divergence located on the east side of Manzanita
Bay and terminating at the south end of the bay, this drift cell
displays a southward net shore-drift.  This drift direction is
indicated by bulkheads with sedi-ment accumulated on the north side,
and sediment size decreas-ing to the south.
