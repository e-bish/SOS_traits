Suquamish quad

Emerging from a zone of drift divergence located at Arrow Point, this
drift cell displays a southward net shore-drift to its terminus at
Battle Point.  Geomorphic indicators supporting this conclusion are
many. Numerous groins and other drift obstructions show sediment
accumulation on the north side.  Sediments on the beach decrease in
size from cobbles to granules and sand in a southerly direction.
Finally, beach width increases to the south to Battle Point which is a
spit building to the west.
