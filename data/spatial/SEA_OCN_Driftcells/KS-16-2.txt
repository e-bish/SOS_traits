Suquamish quad

Beginning about 1.0 km south of Skiff Point, this drift cell displays
net shore-drift to the southwest and ends at Manitou Beach in Murden
Cove.  This drift direction is indicated by a boat ramp and other
obstacles to drift that have sediment accumulation on the north side
and some decrease in mean sediment size to the southwest.
