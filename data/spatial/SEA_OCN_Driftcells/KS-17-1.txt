Bremerton East quad


This cell originates north of Harper in Section 35, has a westward 
net shore-drift and terminates at the head of Yukon Harbor.
Net shore-drift to the west is indicated by the presence 
of several stone groins with sediment accumulation on the east
side and a stream diversion to the west along the west side of South Colby.
