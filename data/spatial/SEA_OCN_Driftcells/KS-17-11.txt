Bremerton East quad

Originating about 1.3 km west of Restoration Point along its south
shore, this drift cell displays westward then northward net shore-drift
to its terminus at Lynnwood Center.  The origin of this drift cell is
defined as that region where the bedrock (Blakely Formation) composing
Restoration Point becomes more or less continuously covered with
sediment.  Drift direction is indicated by numerous groins and
bulk-heads having sediment accumulation on the east and south side,
beach width increasing and sediment size decreasing towards Lynnwood
Center, and a stream diversion to the north at Pleasant Beach.  At
Beans Point the wave-cut platform representing the Blakely Formation is
overlain by a continuous sediment lens, thus creating the single drift
cell described as 17-11.

Restoration Point and the adjacent coastline have no appreciable net
shore-drift because it is made up of the Blakely Formation.  This is the
largest exposure of bedrock in Kitsap County.
