Bremerton East quad


This drift cell begins about 1.1 km west of Restoration Point, along
its north side, and ends at the head of Blakely Harbor.  Westward net
shore-drift is indicated by a groin field showing sediment accumulation
on the east side, and a decrease in sediment size to the west from
pebbles and sand to sandy mud.  The origin of this drift cell is
defined similarly to that of Drift Cell 17-11.
