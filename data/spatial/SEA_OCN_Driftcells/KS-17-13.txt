Bremerton East qua


Beginning at Port Blakely, this drift cell displays a westerly net
shore-drift to its terminus at the head of Blakely Bay.  The drift
direction is indicated by several boat ramps that have a sediment
accumulation on the east side.  Also, sediment size decreases from
cobbles to granules and sand to the west.
