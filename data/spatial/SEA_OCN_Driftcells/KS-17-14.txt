Duwamish Head quad

This drift cell originates in a zone of drift divergence approximately
0.1 km north of the headland defining the extent of Blakely Harbor on
the north shore and ends at Creosote.  Net shore-drift to the north is
indicated by a general decrease in sediment size to the north and an
increase in beach width to the north.

NANSD at Creosote due to the West Coast Wood Preserving Company facility
built into deep water.
