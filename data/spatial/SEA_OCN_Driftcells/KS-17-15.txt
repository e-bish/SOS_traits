Bremerton East quad

This short drift cell extends from about 0.4 km west of Creosote, on
the south shore of Eagle Harbor, to the west approximately 0.9 km.  Net
shore-drift to the west is indicated by a gradual decrease in sediment
size from pebbles and sand to sand.  Eagle Harbor has a relatively
low-energy wave environment as is indicated by the lack of good
geo-morphic indicators and the amount of mud present.
