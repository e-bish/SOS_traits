Bremerton East quad

Originating along the south shore of Wing Point and ending
approximately 0.7 km west of the shipyard, this drift cell has a
westward net shore-drift direction.  The drift direction is indicated
by a groin field showing sediment accumulation on the east side, a 35
meter stream diversion to the west, and a general decrease in sediment
size to the west.
