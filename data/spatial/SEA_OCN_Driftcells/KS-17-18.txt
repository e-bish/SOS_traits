Duwamish Head quad

This drift cell originates on the north shore of Blake Island at a zone
of divergence located about 0.7 km west of the navigation light.  It
ends at a sand spit in Section 26.  Net shore drift to the west is
indicated by a decrease in bluff slope and sediment size, and an
in-crease in beach width to the west.
