Duwamish Head quad

Originating in a zone of drift divergence in the vicinity of survey
marker 15 and ending at the east end of the marina, this drift cell
displays a northward net shore-drift.  This drift direction is
indicated by a decrease in sediment size and an increase in beach width
to the north.
