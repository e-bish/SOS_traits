Bremerton east quad


Originating in a zone of drift divergence in the vicinity of survey
marker 15 and ending at the east end of the marina, this drift cell
displays a northward net shore-drift.  This drift direc-tion is
indicated by a decrease in sediment size and an increase in beach width
to the north.  This drift cell originates about 0.4 km to the west of
survey marker 15 and terminates at a sand spit in Section 26.
North-westward net shore-drift is indicated by increasing beach width
and decreasing sediment size to the north.


No significant net shore drift occurs at Orchard POint due to the presence
of the Blakely Formation which is more resistant to weathering and erosion than
the adjacent materials, thus acting as a natural bulkhead with no beach present.
