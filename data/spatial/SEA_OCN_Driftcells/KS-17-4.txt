Bremerton East quad

This short drift cell begins west of the north shore of Orchard Point
and ends at the head of Clam Bay.  Net shore-drift to the west is
indicated by resistant ridges of the Blakely Formation transecting the
beach, acting as natural groins, and other drift obstructions showing
sediment accumulation on the east side.
