Bremerton quad

This small drift cell originates at Middle Point and ends along the
north shore of Clam Bay.  Southward net shore-drift is indicated by
Blakely Formation outcrops having sediment accumulation on the north
side, and sediment size diminishing to the south.

No appreciable net shore drift from Middle Point north around Point 
Glover to Waterman Point due to the almost continuous presence of the 
Blakely Formation.  Small pockets of sediment found through this area 
show that if there were net shore-drift it would be to the south from 
Point Glover to Middle Point and north from Waterman Point to Point 
Glover.
