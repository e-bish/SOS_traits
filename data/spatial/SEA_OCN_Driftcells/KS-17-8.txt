This segment is the southern part and terminus of a drift cell
beginning in a zone of drift divergence about 0.3 km north of Gilberton
(see Map KS-15, Segment 15-1).  Net shore-drift to the south is
indicated by sediment accumulated on the north side of a concrete boat
ramp and a sand spit building to the south at the end of the drift cell
0.6 km west of University Point.
