Bremerton East and Suquamish quads


This cell originates at a small divergence zone at Point White, 
displays a north-ward net shore-drift and ends at Battle Point.  
This conclusion is supported by many geomorphic indicators. 
Approximately 0.5 km south of Crystal Springs there is a 3 meter 
stream diversion to the north.  Numerous groins, bulkheads, and 
other drift obstruc-tions consistently show sediment accumulation 
on the south side.  Sediment size decreases from boulders,
cobbles, and pebbles at Point White to pebbles, sand, and shell
fragments as one moves north.  The spit in section 18 south of 
Battle Point has completely sealed off the reentrant it was crossing
since the publication and updating of the Suquamish Washingtn USGS 
topographic quadrangle. Additional evidence of northward drift is the
change in beach width; it increases to the north from about 5 meters 
at Point White to approximately 20 meters in the north.
