Bremerton West

This drift cell begins at the western edge of a riprap bulkhead, which
extends to the south under the Highway 303 bridge, and terminates in
Anderson Cove.  Net shore-drift to the west is indicated by a general
decrease in sediment size and an increase in beach width to the west.

The north shore of Anderson Cove to the headland marking the eastern
extent of Phinney Bay is characterized by no apparent net shore-drift.
This is due to the extensive outcropping of the Blakely Formation in
this coastal segment resulting in discontinuous sediment lenses.
