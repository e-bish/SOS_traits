Bremerton West

Originating at the southeast end of Madrona Point and ending along its
northeast side, this drift cell has northward net shore-drift.  The
drift direction is indicated by sediment accumulation on the south side
of bulkheads and other drift obstructions, and a general in-crease in
beach width to the north.
