Bremerton West

Originating along the north shore of Elwood Point and terminating at
the head of Ostrich Bay, this drift cell has southward net
shore-drift.  This drift direction is indicated by bulkheads and groins
with sediment accumulating on the north side, and an increase in beach
width and a decrease in sediment size to the south.
