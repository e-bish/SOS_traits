This drift cell begins along the southeast end of Erlands Point and
ends along the south side of a cuspate spit in the northeast portion of
Section 4.  Northward net shore-drift is indicated by a general
increase in beach width to the north and sediment accumulating on the
south side of bulkheads and other drift obstructions, as well as the
development of the cuspate spit.
