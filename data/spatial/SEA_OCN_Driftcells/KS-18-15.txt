Bremerton West

Southward net shore-drift in this drift cell begins in a divergence
zone at the north end of Erlands Point and ends about 0.6 km to the
south along the north side of a cuspate spit.  This drift direction is
indicated by sediment accumulating on the northwest side of bulkheads
and groins and the presence of the spit at the drift cell terminus.
