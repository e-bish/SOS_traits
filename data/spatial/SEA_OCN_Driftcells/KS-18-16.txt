Bremerton West

Beginning in a zone of drift divergence at the north end of Erlands
Point and ending about 0.7 km to the south in Chico Bay, this drift
cell displays a southward net shore-drift.  This drift direction is
indicated by sediment accumulating on the north side of groins and
bulkheads and a slight increase in beach width and a decrease in beach
sediment size to the south.
