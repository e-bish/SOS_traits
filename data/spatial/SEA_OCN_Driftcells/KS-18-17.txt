Bremerton West

This drift cell originates in a zone of drift divergence located in
Section 32 on the west side of Dyes Inlet and ends along the west side
of Chico Bay.  Southward net shore-drift is indicated by bulk-heads and
other drift obstructions with sediment accumulating on the north side,
and a decrease in beach sediment size to the south.
