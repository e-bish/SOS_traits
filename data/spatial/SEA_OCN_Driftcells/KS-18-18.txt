Bremerton West

Originating in a divergence zone in Section 32 on the west side of Dyes
Inlet and terminating at Silverdale, this drift cell has north-ward net
shore-drift.  The drift direction is indicated by several spits
building to the north and east, a small stream diversion to the north,
numerous groins and other drift obstructions with sediment
accumulating on the south side, and a decrease in sediment size to the
north.
