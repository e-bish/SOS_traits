Bremerton West

This drift cell begins at Sulphur Spring on the east side of Dyes
Inlet, about 1.6 km south of Tracyton, and terminates at the north end
of Dyes Inlet.  Net shore-drift to the north is indicated by groins and
other drift obstruc-tions with sediment accumulation on the south side,
numerous stream diversions to the north, several spits building to the
north, and increasing beach width and decreasing sediment size to the
north.
