Bremerton West quad

Originating at the headland marking the eastern extent of Phinney Bay
and ending along its southeast shore, this drift cell has a southward
net shore-drift.  This drift direction is indicated by a decrease in
sediment size to the south and the accumulation of sediment on the
north side of bulkheads and other drift obstructions.
