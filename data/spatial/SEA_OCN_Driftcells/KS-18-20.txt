Bremerton West


This cell originates in a zone of drift divergence 0.6 km west of Point 
Herron and ends about 0.7 km south of Sulphur Spring at the southern 
boundary of an exposure of the Blakely Formation.  Net shore-drift to 
the north is indicated by bulkheads and other drift obstructions with 
sediment accumulated on the south side, and a stream diversion to the 
north and an increase in beach width to the north.
