Bremerton West

This drift cell originates in a zone of drift divergence located
approximately 0.3 km south of Bass Point and ends along the distal end
of the spit to the south of the Bremerton Yacht Club.  Net shore-drift
to the south is indicated by two spits building to the south and a
south-ward decrease in beach sediment size.
