Bremerton West

Beginning in a divergence zone about 0.3 km south of Bass Point, this
drift cell has a northward net shore-drift to its terminus against the
southern boundary of the Blakely Formation at Bass Point.  The drift
direction is indicated by sediment accumulation on the south side of a
groin and a decrease in sediment size from cobbles, pebbles, and sand
to granules and sand to the north.

NANSD characterizes the coast north of Bass Point to Rocky Point and
continues south down the west side of the Rocky Point peninsula to the
southernmost rock exposure.  Sediment in this area is present only in
discontinuous lenses mantling the wave-cut platform and low cliff made
up of the Blakely Formation.
