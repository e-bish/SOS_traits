Bremerton West

This drift cell has a southerly net shore-drift from its origin in the
area south of the southernmost rock exposure on the west side of the
Rocky Point peninsula to its terminus near the head of Mud Bay.  The
drift direction is indicated by sediment accumulation on the north
side of bulkheads and several small spits building to the south.
