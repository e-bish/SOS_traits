Bremerton West

Originating in a zone of divergence located at the north end of the
Marine Drive peninsula, this drift cell ends near the head of Mud Bay.
Southward net shore-drift is indicated by several small spits building
to the south, sediment accumulation on the north side of groins and
other drift obstructions, and a general decrease in sediment size to
the south.
