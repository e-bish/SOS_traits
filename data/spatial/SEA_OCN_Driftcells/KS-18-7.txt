Bremerton West

This drift cell begins in a divergence zone located at the north end of
the Marine Drive peninsula and ends about 0.2 km to the south along the
north shore of a spit.  Net shore drift to the south is indicated by an
increase in beach width and a slight decrease in sediment size to the
south.
