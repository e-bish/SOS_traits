The northward net shore-drift of this drift cell begins at the south
end of the Marine Drive peninsula and ends on the south shore of a spit
located 0.2 km south of the survey marker at the north end of the
peninsula.  This drift direction is indicated by a consistent
accumulation of sediment on the south side of groins and other drift
obstructions, a general decrease in sediment size to the north, and the
aforementioned spit.
