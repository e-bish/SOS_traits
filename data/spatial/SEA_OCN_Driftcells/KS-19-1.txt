Bremerton East quad

This drift cell originates in a broad zone of divergence located in
the vicinity of the Veterans Home and terminates at Waterman Point 
where coastal sediment gives way to cliffs and wave-cut platforms of 
the Blakely Formation.
  
Eastward net shore-drift is indicated by several groins and bulkheads
with sediment accumulation on the southwest side, decreasing sediment 
size to the northeast, and a northeasterly increase in beach width. In
addition, several streams exhibit consistent stream diversion to the north.  
NANSD characterizes the entire inner Sinclair Inlet.  This coastal area
has been modified to such a degree by the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard,
the Burlington Northern Railroad, coastal roads, and various
commercial establishments that very little of the foreshore profile is
left.  There are some sediment lenses left along the south shore of
Sinclair Inlet which, in themselves, are inconclusive indicators of the
net shore-drift that existed prior to this extensive coastal modification.
