Bremerton East

This drift cell originates in an area centered at Point Turner and ends
along the south shore of a reentrant located about 0.4 km north of the
Manette Bridge.  Northerly net shore-drift is indicated by sediment
accumulation on the south sides of several bulkheads.

The area to the north of this reentrant is characterized by riprap 
construction protecting the bluff.
