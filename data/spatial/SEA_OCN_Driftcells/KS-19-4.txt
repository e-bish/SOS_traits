Bremerton East quad

This drift cell originates about 0.2 km west of Point Herron and
terminates along a sand spit about 0.6 km west of University Point.
Northward net shore-drift is indicated by bulkheads and groins with a
sediment accumulation on the southwest side, a stream diversion to the
northeast, increasing beach width to the north and decreasing sediment 
size to the north-east.
