The drift cell begins in a zone of divergence about 2.9 km north of Point Julia 
immediately south of the rock and terminates at the north shore Point Julia . Net 
shore-drift tothe south is indicated by sediment accumulation on the north side of
a concrete boat ramp found about O.3 km south of the rock, stream diver-sion to the 
south approximately 0.7 km north of Point Julia, a decrease in mean beach
sediment size to the south, and an increase in beach width to the
south.  The drift cell terminus is along the north shore of Point
Julia, a sand spit building to the southwest.  At Point Julia there is
a 100 meter stream diversion to the south-west, emptying into Hood
Canal near the distal end of the spit.
