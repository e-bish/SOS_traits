Port Gamble quad


This drift cell begins in a zone of diver-gence located along the east
shore of Port Gamble in Section 17 and ends along the southern shore of
Point Julia.  Northward net shore-drift is indicated by a stream
diversion to the north and drift obstructions (trees, logs, etc.)
showing sediment accumulation on the south side.  It should be noted at
this point that Port Gamble possesses a moderately low wave-energy
environment.  This is due to the limited fetch (distance of water over
which the wind blows unimpeded) and the protection from the
predominant (strongest) southerly winds.  This results in a subtle
pattern of small changes in the geomorphic indicators present.
