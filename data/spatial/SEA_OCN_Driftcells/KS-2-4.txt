Port Gamble quad

Displaying southward net shore-drift, this drift cell originates along
the west side of Port Gamble in Section 17 and ends along the
southwestern extremity of Port Gamble.  The drift direction is
indicated by increasing beach width to the south and a spit building to
the south.  From the area in which the cell originates, and north
to the Pope and Talbot sawmill, the coast of Port Gamble is completely
blockaded by rafts of logs waiting to be processed.  The dampening
effect of this barrier on wind-waves has resulted in no apparent net
shore-drift along this entire coastal sector.  The sediment consists
of mud with some fine-grained sand.  At the east side of the mouth of
Port Gamble the sawmill facility has been built out over the foreshore
into deep water, resulting in no apparent net shore-drift for this
area too.
