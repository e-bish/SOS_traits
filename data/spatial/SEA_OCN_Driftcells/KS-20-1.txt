Olalla quad

This drift cell has an unconfirmed point of origin in Pierce County.  
Net shore-drift to the north is indicated by numerous groins and bulk-
heads that have sediment accumulated on the south side, stream diversion 
to the north at Wilson Creek, bluff slope generally decreasing to the 
north, beach width generally increasing to the north, and a spit building 
to the north at Olalla Bay.  Approximately 1.7 km south of Southworth a large
outcrop of peat is exposed in the bluff.  Fragments of peat are found
only to the north of this outcrop, making it useful as an identifiable
point-source of sediment with which to trace sediment movement and aid
in determining a net shore-drift direction. This drift cell ends at
Point Southworth.
