Bremerton East

Beginning about 0.5 km east of Harper, this drift cell displays an
eastward net shore-drift to its terminus at Point Southworth. Drift
indicators are subtle due to the presence of several relatively short
fetches created by the position of Blake Island.  Several groins and
bulkheads exhibit sediment accumulation on the west side and beach
sediment size decreases to the east.
