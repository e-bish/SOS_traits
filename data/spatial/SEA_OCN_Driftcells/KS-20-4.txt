Originating in a divergence zone located in Section 35 and ending at
the head of an embayment approximately 0.6 km to the south-south-east,
this drift cell displays a southward net shore-drift.  Drift direction
indicators present are a 5 meter stream diversion to the south and a
boat ramp showing sediment accumulation on the north side.
