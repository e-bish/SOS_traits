Seabeck quad

This drift cell with a southerly netshore-drift, originates at a zone of d
ivergence approximately 2.0 km north of Warrenville and terminating at the 
head of Seabeck Bay.  At Anderson Creek there is a spit building to the south
in front of a marshy grassland. Proceeding south from Warrenville to Big Beef
Harbor the beach widens and the beach sediment becomes finer.  At Big
Beef Harbor a spit has been built upon and utilized as a roadbed.
However, there is a relict recurve present, indicating southerly
drift.  Just south of the benchmark on the headland between Little and
Big Beef Harbors there is a large concrete groin with significant
sediment accumulation on the north side.
