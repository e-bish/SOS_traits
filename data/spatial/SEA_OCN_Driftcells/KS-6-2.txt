
Seabeck quad


Originating at a zone of divergence just west of Misery Point, this
drift cell has a net shore-drift to the southwest along the west shore
of Seabeck Bay.  To the immediate south of Misery Point there is an
excellent example of a recurved spit build-ing to the south.  This
drift sector termi-nates at the head of Seabeck Bay where a spit is
building to the south.
