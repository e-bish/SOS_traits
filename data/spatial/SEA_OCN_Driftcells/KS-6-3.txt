Seabeck quad

Beginning at a zone of drift divergence about 100 meters west of Misery
Point this cell has a southwest to southerly net shore-drift.  There
are boat ramps at Miami Beach and Maple Beach with sediment accumulated
on the north side.  Between Maple Beach and the terminus of the drift
cell at Stavis Bay in Section 30 there are two significant spits
building to the south-west. This drift cell ends along the northern
Stavis Bay spit.
