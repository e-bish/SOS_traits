Seabeck quad

This short drift cell is caused by the curvature of the west side of
Stavis Bay interacting with waves from the north, resulting in net
shore-drift to the southeast.  This drift direction is indicated by a
fining of sediment to the southeast, increasing beach width, and a sand
spit building to the east from the southwest shore of Stavis Bay.
