Seabeck, Brinnon and Holly quads


Originating at a localized zone of divergence along the west shore of
Stavis Bay this cell has a net shore-drift to the southwest.  This
is indicated by beach sediment fining from cobbles and pebbles in the 
north to sand and granules at Hood Point.  In addition, a  3-meter-tall 
stone bulkhead built out over the beach in the northeast corner of 
Section 26, creates a partial barrier to sediment transport.  The beach
to the south of this feature is of a noticeably finer composition than 
the beach to the north of it.

This drift cell terminates along the north shore of Hood Point.
