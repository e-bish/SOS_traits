Holly quad

This drift cell originates at a zone of divergence located
approximately 1.2 km north of Nellita and terminates along the south
shore of Hood Point.  The northward net shore-drift is a result of
southwesterly wind-generated waves.  This drift direction is indicated
by groins and other obstructions to drift showing accumulation on the
south side, and sediment size decreasing from pebble and sand to just 
sand to the north.
