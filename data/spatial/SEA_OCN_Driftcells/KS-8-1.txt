Holly quad


This drift cell originates about 1.2 km north of Nellita.  Southerly 
net shore-drift is indicated by decreasing sediment size to the south, 
a southerly increase in beach width, and several large trees fallen across
the beach showing sediment accumulation on the north side.  A large 
(0.6 m diameter) log lying across the beach, still rooted into the bluff 
shows sediment accumulation on the north side, and a sand spit building to 
the south.  The cell terminus is at Tekiu Point
