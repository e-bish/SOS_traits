Holly quad

This drift cell begins in a zone of divergence about 0.5 km north of
Anderson Cove and ends at Tekiu Point.  A northerly net shore-drift
direction is indicated by a change in bluff morphology from the
divergence zone to the region just south of Tekiu Point.  In the
divergence zone the beach material is mostly cobbles and pebbles with
an occasional boulder.  This beach material size gradually decreases to
the north until at Tekiu Point it is a predominantly pebble and sand
composition.
