Holly quad

Originating approximately 0.5 km north of Anderson Cove and ending
along the northern shore of Anderson Cove, this drift cell displays a
southward net shore-drift.  This drift direction is indicated by
increasing beach width and decreasing size to the south.  The central
portion of Anderson Cove is characterized by mudflats with peat exposed
along the stream channel. There is no apparent net shore-drift evident
in this area.
