Holly quad

This is the northern section and terminus of a drift cell which
originates in Section 25.  The northerly directed net
shore-drift of this segment is indicated by beach sediment size
decreasing to the north, a boat ramp on the south shore of the
embayment with sediment accumulated on the east side, and a stream
diversion to the north in the central portion of the embayment.  This
drift cell ends along the south shore of Anderson Cove where the sand
beach gives way to mud flats.
