This drift cell originates immediately south of the survey marker in 
Section 25. Northerly net shore-drift is indicated by sediment
accumulation on the south side of several large trees fallen across
the beach, a boat ramp on the south shore of the embayment with sediment 
accumulated on the east side, and a stream diversion to the north in the 
central portion of the embayment, and generally decreasing sediment size 
to the north. This drift cell ends along the south shore of Anderson Cove
where the sand beach gives way to mud flats.
