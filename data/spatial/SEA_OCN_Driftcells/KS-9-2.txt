This drift cell begins at a zone of divergence immediately south of
the survey marker in Section 25 and ends at Chinom Point.  Net
shore-drift to the south is indicated by sediment size decreasing from
cobbles to granules and sand to the south and several trees lying
across the beach showing sediment accumulation of 0.5 meter height on
the north side.
