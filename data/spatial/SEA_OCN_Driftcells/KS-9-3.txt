Eldon quad

This segment includes the northern part and terminus of a drift cell
originating in Mason County, on the north side of Dewatto Bay.  Net 
shore-drift to the north in the Kitsap County segment is indicated 
by increasing beach width and decreasing sediment size to the north.

The coastline from Holly to Chinon Point is characterized by steep,
well vegetated bluffs showing all the signs of a strongly sub-aerial
erosion environment (tilting trees, slumping, landslides etc.).  This
constant influx of sediment into the coastal zone along the entire
length of this shoreline creates and environment of poorly defined 
geomorphic and sedimentologic net shore-drift indicators with the 
exception of Chinom Point.
