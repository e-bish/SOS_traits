Shaw Island, Blakely Island quads

This cell exhibits eastward net shore-drift across the shore of southern Shoal Bay.  Glacial till and outwash sand and gravel are present at the base of the Upright Head peninsula in Shoal Bay where the cell originates (Shaw Island quadrangle).  Eastward net shore-drift across shore of southern Shoal Bay is indicated by a slight eastward decrease in sediment grain size and increased beach width (primarily due to the welding of nearshore bars onto the beachface at the east end of the beach in an easterly direction), and a the progradation of a spit in front of a marsh close to Humphrey Head (Blakely Island quadrangle).  The end of the spit is the terminus of the cell.
