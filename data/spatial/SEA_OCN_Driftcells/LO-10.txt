Lopez Pass quad

This cell and the cell to the immediate north are located east of Mud Bay and have net shore-drift into the head of the embayment immediately west of Shoal Bight.  Net shore-drift originates at low bluffs comprised of glacial till, the sediment source for these cells.  This cell originates at a zone of drift divergence in common with the cell to the south.  The beaches become wider moving into the embayment in both cells and consist of progressively finer sediment, indicating net shore-drift into the embayments, which appear to be shoaling due to net shore-drift.  Drift material is deposited in a zone spanning the final 200 m of each cell.  A short spit occurs in this zone of deposition in cell LO-11.
