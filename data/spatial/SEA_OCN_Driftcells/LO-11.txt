Lopez Pass quad

This cell and the cell to the immediate south are located east of Mud Bay and have net shore-drift into the head of the embayment immediately west of Shoal Bight.  Net shore-drift originates at low bluffs comprised of glacial till, the sediment source for both these cells.  The origin of this cell is 300 m southeast of Skull Island.  The beaches become wider moving into the embayment in both cells and consist of progressively finer sediment, indicating net shore-drift into the embayments, which appear to be shoaling due to net shore-drift.  Drift material is deposited in a zone spanning the final 200 m of each cell.  A short spit occurs in this zone of deposition in this cell.
