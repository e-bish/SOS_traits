Lopez Pass quad

This 300 m cell is found east of Mud Bay and exhibits net shore-drift to the northwest.  The cell originates in the zone of drift divergence in common with the drift cell to the immediate south, located in front of a low elevation bluff composed of glacial till.  Northwestward net shore-drift is indicated by beach width increase and sediment size decrease to the northwest and the progradation of a tombolo at the cell's terminus at Skull Island.  A pocket beach is found immediately north of Skull Island near a small dock and private camp.
