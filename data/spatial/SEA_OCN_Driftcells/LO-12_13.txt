Lopez Pass quad

No appreciable net shore-drift occurs along this stretch of the Lopez Sound shore, extending for approximately 2 km along the rocky coastal sector from Skull Island, north and northeast to Lopez Pass.  On the western shore, a pocket beach is found immediately north of Skull Island near a small dock and private camp.  On the eastern shore, along Rosario Strait, immediately north of Shoal Bight, several beaches separated by rocky prominences are found which may receive a limited amount of drift sediment from the cell to the south at Shoal Bight.  Drift sediment may pass around the rocky prominence at the north end of Shoal Bight on the low tide platform, but no continuous apron of sediment exists around the prominence except below MLLW, suggesting that most drift sediment leaving the terminus of the Shoal Bight cell is deposited in deeper water.
