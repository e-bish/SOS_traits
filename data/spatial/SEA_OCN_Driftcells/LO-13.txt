Lopez Pass quad

This cell is located within Shoal Bight along Rosario Strait with generally northward net shore-drift for 3.2 km.  The cell originates in southern Shoal Bight where drift sediment is derived from glacial till that overlies volcanic rocks.  Two approximately 150-m-long beaches are found at the cell's origin accumulated against the southeastern side of two small rock outcrops that partially interrupt drift, revealing northwestward net shore-drift.  Other indicators include northward beach width increase and sediment size decrease, northward progradation of the tombolo in central Shoal Bight, and a sediment accumulation that is present on the south side of a rock outcrop 400 m south of the cell's terminus.  Net shore-drift continues over the 400 m stretch to the point where the shore orientation changes to face northeast (where a marker identified as Triple on the quadrangle is located).  Varying amounts of beach sediment and drift logs are found along the primarily rocky intertidal platform located south of the Triple point.  Beyond the point, most net shore-drift sediment is probably lost to deeper water, while some sediment may continue alongshore around the point.
