Lopez Pass, Richardson quads

No appreciable net shore-drift occurs from the Cape Saint Mary area and across the entire southern Lopez Island shore to beyond Kings Point (Richardson quadrangle), located across San Juan Channel from San Juan Island.  Pocket beaches are present in virtually all of the bays and harbors of southern Lopez Island, where numerous high, rocky headlands prevent any continuous shore drift systems from occurring.
