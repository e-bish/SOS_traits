Richardson, Shaw Island quads

This cell is the longest drift cell on Lopez Island, at 7.5 km in length.  Net shore-drift is northward along the eastern shore of San Juan Channel.  The cell originates 0.6 km northeast of Kings Point, where rocky shore ends and bluffs comprised of glacial drift begin (Richardson quadrangle).  Outwash sand and gravel and till are all found in bluffs along western Lopez Island, and supply abundant sediment to the shore drift system.  Major bluff erosion is occurring within the shallow embayment between Kings Point and Shark Reef, where 35-m-high bluffs are steep and unvegetated.  A thin veneer of sediment above a wave-cut platform eroded into till comprises a low tide beach of moderate width in this area, consisting of gravel with glacial erratics of up to 3 m in diameter.  North of Shark Reef the low tide beach is narrower than the beach to the south, due to the more exposed nature of this coastal sector. Northward net shore-drift in this sector is indicated by beach width increase and sediment size decrease to the north, progressive increase in bluff vegetation, and an accumulation of sediment on the south side of a rock groin directly west of the Lopez Island airport.  Generally northward net shore-drift north of Rock Point is indicated by a narrow tombolo that has prograded approximately 1.0 km to the north, enclosing Fisherman Bay (Shaw Island quadrangle), sediment accumulations on the south side of rocks partially interrupting drift, nearshore bars oriented northwest-southeast, moving onshore to the north, and a high, 0.6-km-long spit that has prograded most of the way across the entrance to Fisherman Bay.  The terminus of this cell is at the northeast end of the spit.
