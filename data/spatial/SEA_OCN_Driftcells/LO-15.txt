Shaw Island quad

This net shore-drift cell is located within northwestern Fisherman Bay.  Net shore-drift is southeastward for 300 m.  Evidence of southeastward net shore-drift is found in an increase in beach width and decrease in mean sediment size to the southeast, and progradation of a short, sandy spit at the cell terminus.  Southeastward net shore-drift is driven by northerly winds entering Fisherman Bay.
