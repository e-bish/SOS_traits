Shaw Island quad

Net shore-drift in this cell is northeastward for 0.5 km to a depositional zone at a small point in northern Fisherman Bay.  The cell originates at a zone of drift divergence located on a convex reach of shore that consists of a veneer of beach sediment on a wave-cut platform eroded into glacial till.  Northeastward net shore-drift is evidenced by northeastward sediment size decrease and beach width increase, sediment accumulated on the southwest side of rock outcrops partially interrupting drift, and the apparent progradation of the beach at the cell's terminus.
