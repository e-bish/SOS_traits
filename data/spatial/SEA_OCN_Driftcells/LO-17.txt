Shaw Island quad

This 1.3 km cell originates at the zone of drift divergence in common with the cell to the immediate north in central Fisherman Bay and has net shore-drift to the southwest.  The erosional bluff at the cell's origin is comprised of glacial till overlying sandy glacial outwash, which is the sediment source for this cell.  An accumulation of sediment is located on the northeast side of a boat ramp several hundred meters southwest of the drift cell origin, beach width increases and the mean sediment size decreases dramatically to the southwest as the beach grades into a tide flat, indicating southwestward net shore-drift.  Net shore-drift terminates at a mostly enclosed embayment located in southwesternmost Fisherman Bay.
