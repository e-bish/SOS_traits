Shaw Island quad

Generally westward net shore-drift originates from a zone of drift divergence in common with the cell to the north, located in southeast Fisherman Bay.  A low bluff comprised of glacial till overlying sandy outwash is the sediment source for this cell.  The lack of full vegetation cover on the low bluff reveals the erosional nature of the headland, while 150 m west the bluff is well-vegetated and stable, indicating westward net shore-drift. Increased beach width and decreased sediment size to the west, along with northwestward progradation of a sandy spit at the cell's terminus also indicate generally westward net shore-drift.
