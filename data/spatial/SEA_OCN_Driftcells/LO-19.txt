Shaw Island quad

Net shore-drift in this cell originates from a 
zone of drift divergence located in southeast 
Fisherman Bay.  Net shore-drift is generally to 
the north for 1.6 km (passing beneath a number 
of docks built on pilings), evidenced by northward 
beach width increase and sediment size decrease, 
continuing to the southern side of a rip-rap seawall 
that surrounds the Islander Restaurant.  Drift sediment 
passes around this structure on a narrow beach and continues 
northward.  Beach width increases again to experience a 
maximum width at a location 0.5 km north of the Islander 
Restaurant.  Here a stream is offset to the north where 
it crosses the beach, indicating northward net shore-drift.  
Further evidence of northward net shore-drift is provided by 
a sandy spit that has prograded northwestward most of the way 
across the front of a marsh in northern Fisherman Bay.  The 
end of this drift cell is at the distal end of the spit.
