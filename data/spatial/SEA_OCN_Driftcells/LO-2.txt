(Blakely Island quad)
This cell is located in southeast Shoal Bay.  The origin of the cell is located at the northern of the two docks in southeast Shoal Bay.  Net shore-drift is to the south for 0.5 km, depositing at a sandy spit. Abundant drift sediment is derived from eroding deposits of glacial till that overly the sedimentary rocks of southern Humphrey Head, which is the cell's origin.  Moving south, beach width increases rapidly and sediment size fines from boulders and cobbles, to pebbles and sand, indicating southward net shore-drift.  The nearshore zone is shoaling in southeast Shoal Bay as sand and mud are deposited there in this zone of drift convergence.  A sand spit has prograded in front of a salt marsh, leaving a small tidal channel that connects the marsh to Shoal Bay, further indicating southward net shore-drift.  The spit is the terminus of the cell.
