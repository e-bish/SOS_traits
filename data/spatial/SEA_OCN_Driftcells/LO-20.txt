Shaw Island quad

This cell originates in a broad zone of drift divergence located 1 km north of the entrance to Fisherman Bay and the town of Lopez and has southward net shore-drift.  Drift sediment is derived from a bluff consisting of glacial till and outwash sand and gravel, located at the origin of the cell.  Southward net shore-drift is indicated by a steep, minimally-vegetated bluff at the cell origin, which becomes increasingly well-vegetated to the south, a decrease in sediment size from cobble and boulder armor to pebbles and sand over the length of the cell, southward offset of two small streams near the center of the cell, and the progradation of a hooked spit at the cell's terminus, inside the entrance to Fisherman Bay.
