Shaw Island quad

This 2.2-km-long cell originates from a zone of drift divergence 1 km north of the town of Lopez, and has northward net shore-drift to Flat Point.  The sediment source in this cell is an eroding bluff consisting of glacial till and outwash sand and gravel.  The bluff is steep and poorly-vegetated, then becomes well-vegetated to the north, indicating northward net shore-drift.  Northward net shore-drift is also evidenced by a progressive northward increase in beach width and decrease in sediment size, the northwest-southeast orientation of a series of nearshore bars in the central portion of the cell, and the progradation of Flat Point, a large cuspate spit, with ponded water, that constitutes the cell's terminus.
