Shaw Island quad

This 2.3-km-long drift cell begins at an unnamed headland 400 m west of Odlin County Park, in northern Lopez Island.  The headland is a zone of drift divergence, composed of glacial till and outwash sand and gravel, that is poorly-vegetated and eroding.  The bluff is fronted by a narrow, boulder and cobble beach.  Net shore-drift is to the southwest and west, indicated by an increasing amount of bluff vegetation and decreasing bluff slope, decreasing sediment size (to sand and pebbles) and increasing beach width to the southwest, and progradation of Flat Point, a cuspate spit that is the terminus of the cell.
