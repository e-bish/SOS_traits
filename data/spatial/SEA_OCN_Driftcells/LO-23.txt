Shaw Island quad

This cell has eastward net shore-drift that originates at the zone of drift divergence separating this cell from the cell to the south.  Drift material is transported for 0.6 km along Upright Channel to a beach at the base of Upright Head.  The bluff along this cell changes from poorly-vegetated and erosional at the origin, to well-vegetated and stable to the east, indicating net shore-drift in that direction. Other drift indicators in this cell are increasing beach width and decreasing sediment size to the east, and eastward offset of a stream discharging in front of Odlin County Park, where the cell terminates at the eastern end of the beach as it abuts against rocky Upright Head.  No appreciable net shore-drift occurs along the western side of Upright Head, which is composed of resistent sedimentary rocks.  Isolated boulder accumulations on a very narrow wave-cut platform are found here, with no continuous shore drift.
