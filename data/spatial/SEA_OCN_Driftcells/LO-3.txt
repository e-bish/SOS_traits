Blakely Island quad

This cell originates at the southern base of the 80-m-high Humphrey Head, at the beginning of the beach within Swifts Bay.  The sediment source for this cell is glacial till, occurring at the origin and over most of the length of the cell.  Net shore-drift is to the south and southeast for 1.5 km, depositing in the beach at the town of Stanley. The northern portion of the cell has an erosional bluff with little vegetation covering the till bluff face, while the low bluffs along the remainder of the cell are fairly well-vegetated, indicating generally southward net shore-drift.  Southward net shore-drift is also indicated by increasing beach width and decreasing sediment size to the south, and the orientation of nearshore bars moving into the head of the bay.
