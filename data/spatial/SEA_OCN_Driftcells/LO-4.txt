Blakely Island quad

This is a short (0.7 km) cell located on the southeast shore of Swifts Bay.  Net shore-drift is to the southwest.  The origin of the cell is found at the zone of drift divergence on the north end of an erosional headland that is located southwest of Flower Island.  The headland is comprised of glacial till overlying outwash sand, which is the sediment source for this cell.  The north side of the headland is mostly unvegetated, and is fronted by a coarse gravel beach with abundant boulders.  Moving southwest along the shore, the bluff becomes well-vegetated and stable, then, an accretionary beach fronts a marsh. The beach becomes wider along this sector and is comprised of finer sediment (sand and pebbles) in front of the marsh, indicating net shore-drift to the southwest.  The cell terminates at the center of the accretionary beach in southern Swifts Bay, that is a zone of drift convergence in common with the drift cell to the north.
