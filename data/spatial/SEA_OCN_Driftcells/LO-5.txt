Blakely Island quad

Southeastward net shore-drift originates from the zone of drift divergence this cell has in common with the cell to the north, located southwest of Flower Island.  Net shore-drift continues for 1.2 km to Spencer Spit. The erosional headland at the cell's origin is comprised of glacial till overlying outwash sand, both providing the sediment source for this cell.  An unvegetated bluff reveals the erosional nature of the headland, while 200 m southeast of the headland the bluff is well-vegetated and stable, indicating net shore-drift to the southeast.  The headland is fronted by a narrow, gravel beach with abundant boulders, while a relatively wide, sandy beach is found 400 m to the southeast, indicating southeastward net shore-drift.  The base of Spencer Spit is found at this location.  Other evidence of southeastward net shore-drift includes a series of nearshore bars oriented towards southeastward movement, located immediately north of the base of the spit, southeastward offset of a tidal channel that crosses the beach, and the progradation of Spencer Spit, a cuspate spit. The end of Spencer Spit is the terminus of the cell.  Southeastward net shore-drift is caused by the open northerly fetch in combination with refraction of waves from other directions around Frost Island, which act to build the northern segment of the spit.
