Blakely Island quad

At 5.0 km in length, this is the longest drift cell along eastern Lopez Island.  This cell originates at a zone of drift divergence at a rocky prominence located 4.5 km south of the base of Spencer Spit, northwest of Small Island (Lopez Pass quadrangle).  Net shore-drift is to the northeast along the shore of Lopez Sound to the tip of Spencer Spit (Blakely Island quadrangle).  Glacial till and outwash sand are found in the erosional bluffs present along most of this cell, providing abundant sediment to the shore drift system.  Several bluff failures have occurred in the glacial material, providing additional drift sediment.  A narrow, coarse-gravel beach fronts the bluff in the southern 2 km of the drift cell.  Glacial erratics consisting of boulders over 3 m in diameter are present in the nearshore area here, while sediment in Spencer Spit is predominantly sand, present in a relatively wide beach.  The decrease in sediment size and increase in beach width, along with the progradation of Spencer Spit indicate northeastward net shore-drift.  The tip of the spit, which constitutes the terminus of the drift cell, has prograded to within 200 m of Frost Island.  Spencer Spit will probably never connect to Frost Island due to strong tidal currents that flow through the intervening channel.
