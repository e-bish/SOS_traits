Lopez Pass quad

This 0.8 km cell originates along the western shore of Lopez Sound, northwest of Small Island.  Net shore-drift is southeastward, depositing sediment in a short tombolo that has prograded to a small rock feature.  The sediment source for this cell is glacial till, occurring in bluffs at the cell origin.  Beach width increases and sediment grain size decreases locally to the southeast as sediment accumulates on the northwest side of rock outcrops, within each section of shore demarcated by outcrops, indicating southeastward net shore-drift.  No appreciable net shore-drift occurs from the terminus of the cell south to Mud Bay.  Discontinuous and isolated pocket beaches are located along this coast, with two pocket beaches present in Hunter Bay.
