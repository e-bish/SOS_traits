Lopez Pass quad

This 1.5 km cell is located on the northwest shore of Mud Bay and has southwestward net shore-drift into the head of Mud Bay, where a broad pocket beach is located.  Drift material originates from glacial till found in bluffs approximately 200 m southwest of the headland separating Mud Bay from the origin of the cell at Hunter Bay.  Beach width increases from the origin to the southwest for 0.8 km, where the beach becomes narrower in front of a greenstone cliff.  Local net shore-drift indicators are present within this sector and the sector southwest of the cliff that continues to the head of the bay: accumulations of sediment occur on the northeast side of obstacles partially interrupting drift, and beach width increases and sediment size decreases to the southwest.  Sediment reaching the head of the bay contains a considerable proportion of mud.  A large tide flat is found here and the majority of Mud Bay is less than 4 m deep.
