Lopez Pass quad

This cell originates at a zone of drift divergence along the southeast shore of Mud Bay with southwestward net shore-drift to the head of Mud Bay.  The sediment source for this cell is eroding glacial till found at the shore along most of this drift cell.  A narrow beach at the origin of the cell is comprised of poorly sorted sand and gravel, with glacial erratics up to 3 m in diameter.  Sediment size decreases to predominantly sand near the head of the bay in a relatively wide beach, fronted by a tide flat, indicating southwestward net shore-drift. Additional evidence of southwestward net shore-drift is provided by the westward offset of a tidal channel from a marsh in southernmost Mud Bay.  Net shore-drift ends at the pocket beach at the southwest end of the bay.
