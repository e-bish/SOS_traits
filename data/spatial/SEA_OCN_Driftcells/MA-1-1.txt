Holly quad

This drift cell originates to the northeast in Jefferson County.  Net
shore-drift to the southwest is indicated by sediment accumulation on
the northeast and erosion on the southwest of several groins.  In
addition, although the beach is narrow, it widens somewhat to the
southwest.  Triton Cove is protected from prevailing southwest winds by
a basaltic headland (Triton Head) and is open to the northeast so that
northeast winds with a fetch of up to 20 km become the predominant
drift influence.
