Originating near the northern tip of Triton Head, drift in this short
sector is to the west into Triton Cove.  Although there is not a large
supply of sediment for transport, there are slight accumulations east
of boat launch rails which extend across the shore.  Triton Head is
formed of more resistant basaltic rocks of the Crescent Formation and
extends into deep water, resulting in no appreciable net shore-drift,
although in extreme storm conditions there may be some sediment
bypass.
