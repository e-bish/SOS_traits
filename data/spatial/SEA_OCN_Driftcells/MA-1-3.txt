The northeastward drift of this sector begins at the approximate
boundary of Sections 12 and 13, and terminates along the south side of
Triton Head.  There is a markedly abrupt beginning to this sector where
a small delta has formed at the northern end of a series of basalt
outcrops which extend into deep water.  Northeastward from the delta,
there is a sediment size decrease from predominantly large pebbles to
smaller pebbles. Small groins along a bulkhead in Section 12 have
sediment accumulated on the south-west sides.  At Beacon Point, a small
developed area (Section 6), a boat ramp which extends about 30 m across
the upper shore has blocked sediment so that there is now a vertical
offset of the shore of about 1 m and a horizontal offset of nearly 10
m.  The Beacon Point development is built in part upon the delta of
Schaerer Creek.  The beach immediately north of the delta appears
somewhat eroded and the sediment again decreases in size gradationally
to a sand-granule-pebble spit built northeasterly at the sector terminus.
The spit encloses a lagoon on the south side of Triton Head. Drainage
from the lagoon is at the northeast end of the spit abutting the basalt
which forms the headland. There do not appear to be appreciable amounts 
of sediment bypassing the southern point of Triton Head.
