Eldon quad

This 0.5 km sector originates in the southwest corner of Section 13,
immediately south of the delta of a small stream, and terminates to the
north at the southern end of a series of basalt outcrops which
effectively block sediment movement.  Northward drift is indicated by
a sediment size decrease in that direction, by a large sediment
accumulation south of a groin and erosion north of that groin at a
local resort, and by a small intermittent stream which is diverted
northward.
