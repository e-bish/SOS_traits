Eldon quad

A very short sector of southward drift from the divergence zone south
of the stream mouth in southwest Section 13 to the small rocky headland
in northwest Section 24 is indicated by a decrease in sediment size to
the south and by piling of sediment on the north sides of portions of
the headland.  South of the small headland in northwest Section 24,
cliffs of basalt of the Crescent Formation prevent any appreciable
shore-drift.
