Lilliwaup, Lake Wooten quads

From a divergence zone in southeast Section 23, drift in this sector
continues approximately 2.8 km northeastward and terminates at a deltaic
prograding convergence zone at the mouth of Shoofly Creek (Section 18). 
Net shore-drift indicators include sediment accumulations to the
southwest of numerous groins and bulkheads; widening of the beach
northeastward; sediment size decrease northeastward; beach slope
increase northeastward; a few oblique bars moving from the southwest; 
and northeastward diversion of the mouth of Shoofly Creek.  In addition, 
fragments of asphalt can be traced back from the terminus area, 
southeastward about 400 m, to an asphalt fill which was constructed 
to prevent erosion of private property.
