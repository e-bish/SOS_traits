Lake Wooten quad

This drift cell begins at a divergence zone about 0.5 km northeast of
the mouth of Shoofly Creek (Section 18) and terminates at the
prograding convergence zone at the mouth of the creek.  Southwesterly
net shore-drift is indicated by a decrease of sediment size and
increase in beach width to the southwest, and also a steepening of the
slope of the beach south-westward.
