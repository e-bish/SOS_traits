Lake Wooten quad

Net shore-drift in this cell is eastward from a divergence zone in
Section 18 to a commercially-developed prograded point about 1 km east
(Section 17).  There are sediment accumulations west of numerous groins
and bulkheads, the beach becomes wider and steeper toward the terminus,
the sediment size decreases eastward, and a small stream (Section 17)
is diverted eastward.  The cell terminates in a small cove on the east
side of the development.  The developed area is mostly fill placed on
a deltaic prograding area which may have been similar to the area at
the mouth of Shoofly Creek (Section 18).  Fill for the development
apparently came from a gravel pit located directly north across the
road.  Devegetation of the steep slopes and removal of bluff material
has resulted in a constantly disintegrating bluff of incohesive outwash
gravel which is only 50-80m from the road and several fairly
recently-built houses.
