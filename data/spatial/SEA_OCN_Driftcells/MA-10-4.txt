Lake Wooten quad

Whether this drift cell is a long-term feature or the result of
development at the prograded area in Section 17 is unclear.  However,
the small cove, on the east side of the development area, which may
have been intended as a marina, is now filling with sediment coming
from the west and from the east.  This cell originates less than 
100 m to the east of the cove where beach erosion is occurring.  
A wedge of sediment is being transported into the cove from this 
divergence zone.
