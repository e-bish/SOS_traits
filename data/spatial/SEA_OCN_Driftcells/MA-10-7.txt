Lake Wooten quad

This drift cell originates about 0.5 km east of the point at Twanoh
State Park.  Termination is at a convergence zone at the point.
Westerly drift is indicated by sediment accumulations to the east of
groins  and bulkheads, sediment size decrease towards the terminus, and
steepening of the beach slope to the convergence zone.
