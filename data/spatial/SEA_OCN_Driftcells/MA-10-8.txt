Lake Wooten quad

This drift cell begins at a divergence zone a short distance east of
Twanoh State Park (Section 20) and terminates at a
convergence zone at Sunset Beach (Section 12).  Indicating
northeastward drift are sediment accumulations southwest of a great
many groins, bulkheads, and boat ramps, numerous nearshore bars
oriented northeasterly, and several small spits growing toward the
northeast.  Associated with the spits, beach widening and steepening
increase northeastward and sediment size decreases.  Marking the
termination of this segment is a recurved spit at Sunset Beach.
