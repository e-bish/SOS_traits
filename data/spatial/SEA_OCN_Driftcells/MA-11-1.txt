Lake Wooten quad

This cell begins at a divergence zone immediately east of the point in Section
17 and terminates at a complex recurved spit in northwest Section 11. 
Geomorphic features indicating northeastward drift are sediment
accumulations southwest of numerous groins, bulkheads, and boat ramps; 
a decrease of sediment size to the east; nearshore bars oriented toward 
the northeast; northeastward diversion of small streams; increase of 
beach width and slope toward the terminus; and the eastward orientation 
of the complex recurved spit at the terminus.
