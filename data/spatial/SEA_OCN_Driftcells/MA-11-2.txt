Lake Wooten quad

This drift cell begins at a divergence zone located approximately at
the boundary between Sections 1 and 2.  The beach at the divergence
zone is cobbly and eroding.  Net shore-drift to the southwest is
indicated by decrease of sediment size and a 200 m long sand bar or
spit-platform, in the embayment east of Sunbeach, growing southwest
toward Sunbeach.  Also, at Sunbeach, a small stream is diverted to the
southwest.  Drift in this sector terminates rather indistinctly,
converging with the complex spit that marks the terminus of the drift
cell to the west.
