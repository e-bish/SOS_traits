Belfair, Lake Wooten quads

This drift cell originates at a divergence zone located at
approximately the boundary of Sections 1 and 2, and terminates about 3
km to the northeast in Lynch Cove.  Northeasterly net shore-drift is
indicated by a series of northeastward accreting spits, most of which
divert streams in the same direction.  There are also numerous bars
migrating northeast-ward.  Tide flats extend entirely across Hood Canal
from approximately Belfair State Park and northeastward.  This rapid
shallowing reduces the amount of wave energy available for sediment
transport.
