Lake Wooten quad

Westward net shore-drift in this drift cell begins at a divergence zone
0.5 km east of Sunset Beach (Section 12) and ends within the cove
formed by the recurved spit terminus of the drift cell to the west.  Indicating
westerly drift are accumulations of sediment to the east of groins and
bulkheads, and a decrease of sediment size and increase of beach width
westward.
