Lake Wooten, Belfair quads

Originating at a divergence zone east of Sunset Beach, net shore-drift
is again northeastward and terminates at a large spit oriented to the
northeast into Lynch Cove.  There are several smaller spits along the
sector, also oriented northeastward.  Other evidence of net shore-drift
is sediment accumulation southwest of groins and bulkheads, numerous
nearshore bars migrating northeastward, widening of the beach toward
the northeast, and a sediment-size gradational decrease northeastward.
