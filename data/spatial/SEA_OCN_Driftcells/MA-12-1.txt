Originating at a divergence zone about 0.5 km south of the cove in
Section 32, drift in this sector is northward and terminates at that
cove.  At the divergence zone, there is a vertical bluff and the beach
sediment is predominantly pebbles and cobbles.  The sediment size
decreases northward to a sandy spit at the cell terminus.  Also
indicating northward drift are a series of groins that have
accumulations of sediment to the south.
