Northward drift of this cell begins immediately north of the cove in
Section 32 where the adjacent drift cell to the south ends.  The cell 
terminates at the next cove to the north, in Section 29.  Sediment
accumulations south of groins and bulkheads indicate drift to the
north.  The sediment size fines northward to sand at a recurved spit 
at the mouth of the cove in Section 29. Sediment accumulations on the 
south side of groins along this sector also indicate net shore-drift to 
the north.
