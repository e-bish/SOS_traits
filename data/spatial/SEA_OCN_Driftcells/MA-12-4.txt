This drift ector originates at a divergence zone south of Sherwood Creek.
From the wave-cut platform at the divergence zone, drift is northward
across the Sherwood Creek delta and continues to the head of North Bay.
Indicators of northward net shore-drift are sediment accumulations
south of groins, bulkheads, and boat ramps, erosion north of some of
those obstacles, a general decrease of sediment size northward, and at
the terminus, about 1.5 km north of Allyn, a small spit is oriented to
the north.  Along the tidal mudflats at the north end of North Bay, the
sediment is fine, wave energy is low, and grasses encroaching upon the
shore stabilize the sediment, resulting in no appreciable net
shore-drift.
