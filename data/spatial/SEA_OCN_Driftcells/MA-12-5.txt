Originating at Rocky Point, net shore-drift in this sector is
northward, terminating at the mudflats at the head of North Bay.  Rocky
Point is a wave-cut platform littered with cobbles and many boulders.
Sediment size decreases northward indicating drift in that direction.
Accumulations of sediment occur south of groins, bulkheads, and logs,
also indicating northward drift.  About 1 km north of Rocky Point, the
beach widens, beach slope increases, and a sandy berm develops.  Other
indicators of northward net shore-drift are identifiable basalt riprap
fragments which are traceable a short distance north from the source, a
couple of small spits divert stream drainage north, and several old
tires from a partially destroyed bulkhead can be seen up to 100 m north
of the old structure, but none are on the south.  North of Victor, a
fairly large complex spit and several oblique bars are oriented to the
north.  Toward the head of the bay, grass-covered mud spits indicate
that some drift occurs well north onto the mudflats, but beyond them 
there appears to be no appreciable net shore-drift.
