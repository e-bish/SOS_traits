Beginning at a divergence zone at the point immediately east of the
eastern-most cove in Section 23, net shore-drift in this sector is
toward the northeast and terminates in McLane Cove.  Northeastward 
from the cobble-strewn wave-cut platform along the divergence zone, 
the beach widens and becomes steeper, while the sediment-size decreases 
to sand and pebbles.  Sediment is being transported into two small coves 
in Section 24.  However, unlike the coves in Section 23, there appears to be
considerable drift bypassing these coves.  Other indicators of
northeast net shore-drift along this segment are oblique bars oriented
to the northeast and accumulations of sediment southwest of obstacles,
primarily logs.
