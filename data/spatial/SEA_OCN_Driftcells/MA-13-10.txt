Originating at the eroding bluff along the divergence zone at the
northwest corner of Stretch Island, drift in this sector is southward
and terminates at the Stretch Island bridge.  Indicating southward
drift are sediment accumulations north of obstacles and a small
spit-like beach-form oriented southward.
