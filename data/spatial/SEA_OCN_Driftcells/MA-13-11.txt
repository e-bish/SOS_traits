Beginning at a divergence zone on the mainland between Stretch and
Reach Islands, southward drift along this sector is indicated by
sediment accumulations north of obstacles, a decrease of sediment size
and an increase of beach slope.  This drift cell terminates at a
prograding beach at the north side of the Stretch Island bridge.
