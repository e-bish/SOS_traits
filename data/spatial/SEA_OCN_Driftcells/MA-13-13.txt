A divergence zone at the south end of Reach Island is the origin of
this short sector which terminates rather indistinctly in the Reach
Island channel.  Indicating northward drift are slight sediment
accumu-lations south of bulkheads and a decrease of sediment size to
the north.  There is no distinct area of deposition marking drift
termination; instead, there are just no indications of appreciable net
shore-drift beyond a certain point.
