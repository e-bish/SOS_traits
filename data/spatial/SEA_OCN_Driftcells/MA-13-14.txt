Originating at a divergence zone at the south end of Reach Island, net
shore-drift in this sector is northward along the east shore of the
island to the north end, and then south along the west shore to the
Reach Island bridge. A wave-cut platform is exposed along much of the
east shore of this island.  Sediment size, however, decreases
gradationally to the north indicating northward drift.  In addition,
on the south sides of groins, boat ramps, and bulkheads there are
sediment accumulations.  There is also a wave-cut platform at the north
end of the island, and it appears that sediment is transported around
the point where northerly winds become predominant and sediment is then
transported toward the south along the western shore.  Sediment
accumulations north of groins and bulkheads indicate southward drift.
