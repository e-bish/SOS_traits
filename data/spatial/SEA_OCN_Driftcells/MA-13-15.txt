Commencing at a divergence zone at the northward-facing point at Fair
Harbor, drift in this sector is to the south and terminates at the
Reach Island bridge.  Sediment size grades from cobbles, upon a
wave-cut platform at the point, to sand and pebbles at a prograding
beach north of the bridge.  Coupled with this is an increase of the
beach width south-ward.  Both are evidence of southward net
shore-drift.  Slight sediment accumulation north of obstacles also
indicates southward drift.
