Vaughn quad

This sector originates at a divergence zone at the point on the east
side of McLane Cove.  Drift is northward a short distance into the
cove.  A wave-cut platform marks the divergence zone.  Sediment size
decreases and the beach slope increases northward into the cove,
indicating net shore-drift in that direction.
