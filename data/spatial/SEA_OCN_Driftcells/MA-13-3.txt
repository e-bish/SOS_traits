This drift cell begins at a divergence zone at the point on the east
side of McLane Cove.  Northeastward from the wave-cut platform at the
divergence zone, sediment size decreases, the beach widens, and the
beach slope increases, indicating net shore-drift in that direction.
In addition, there are sediment accumulations southwest of logs,
groins, and bulk-heads. This drift cell terminates at a long spit
oriented northward into the embayment between the mainland and Stretch
Island.  The lagoon behind this spit was dredged for boat moorage and a
channel was excavated across the middle of the spit.  A riprap jetty
was emplaced to stabilize the channel.  However, net shore-drift has
continued northward and is reshaping the coast into a more stable
configuration.
