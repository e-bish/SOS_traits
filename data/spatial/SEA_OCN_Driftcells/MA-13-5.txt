Vaughn quad

Northeastward drift of this sector is evidenced by accumulations of sediment
southwest of groins, widening and steepening of the beach to the
north-east, and a gradational size decrease of the sediment.  A pebbly
beach ridge develops where the channel between the mainland and Stretch
Island begins. Drift terminates at the south side of the bridge
footings and the beach there is slowly prograding.
