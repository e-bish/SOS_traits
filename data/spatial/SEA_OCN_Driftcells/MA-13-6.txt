Vaughn quad

This sector originates at the south end of the embayment on the west
side of Stretch Island, and terminates south of the Stretch Island
bridge.  The origin is along a narrow, low energy beach in the lee of a
spit. Northward drift is indicated by accumulations of sediment south
of obstacles and northward widening of the beach.
