Vaughn quad

Drift in this sector is northward from the south end of Stretch Island
along the west side of the island, and terminates at a gravelly spit a
short distance to the north.  Northward from the vertical bluff and
wave-cut platform at the origin (a divergence zone), the beach widens,
the beach slope increases, and the sediment size decreases.
