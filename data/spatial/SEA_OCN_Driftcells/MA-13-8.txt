Vaughn quad

This sector begins at a divergence zone at the south end of Stretch
Island, net sediment transport is north along the east shore of the
island, and terminates at a recurved spit at the northeast end of the
island. Except for a short topographically low area, the entire south
and east shore of Stretch Island is severely eroding due to wave
undercutting.  Indicat-ing northward drift are sediment accumulations
south of logs, a gradational sediment size decrease to the north, and
widening and steepening of the beach to the north.  In addition, the
sector terminates at a sizeable spit growing from the south.
