This drift cell originates at the northwest corner of Stretch Island at
a divergence zone marked by severe bluff erosion.  Net shore-drift of
this sector is toward the east and ends west of the recurved spit at
the northeast corner of the island.  Drift indicators are an increase
of the width of the beach and a decrease of sediment size.
