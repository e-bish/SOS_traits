Mason Lake quad

This segment originates at an erosional area at Sun Point and
terminates at the western-most cove in Section 23.
Severe bluff erosion  at Sun Point has led to extensive bulkhead 
protection (the southwestern-most property owner has cemented the
entire bluff from porch to beach).  Northeasterly drift
is indicated by sediment accumulations southwest of logs and
bulkheads, widening of the beach to the northeast, sediment size
decrease northeastward, steepening of the beach slope northeastward,
and sand bars migrating into the cove from the southwest.
