Mason Lake, Vaughn quads

This drift cell originates within Jarrell Cove at a small, eroding,
southwest-facing point.  The bluff at the point is devoid of
vegetation, and there is only a thin layer of sediment on a wave-cut
platform. Sediment transport out of the channel appears to be minor.
The beach is narrow along the channel, but widens at the outer edge of
the cove, where a vertical, non-vegetated bluff again develops in
response to 3 km of westward fetch. Northeastward the bluff becomes
vegetated and subaerially weathered to a steep slope.  Other indicators
of northeasterly drift are a general decrease of sediment size,
increase of beach slope, northeastward diversion of a small stream,
sediment accumulated southwest of logs, and several oblique bars
oriented toward the northeast. This sector terminates at Indian Cove
which has been dredged for a marina.  The terminus is marked by a lobe
of sand and pebble prograding into the west side of the cove.
