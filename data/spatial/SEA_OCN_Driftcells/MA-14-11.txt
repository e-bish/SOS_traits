Beginning at the east side of Indian Cove, net shore-drift is
northeasterly and terminates at Dougall Point.  At the origin there is
an eroding bluff, however, dredge spoil from the cove has been piled on
the beach there, temporarily obscuring the drift patterns.  Beyond the
origin, evidence of northeasterly drift include a widening of the
beach, decrease of sediment size northeastward, and accumulations of
sediment southwest of logs.  At the terminus, at Dougall Point, there
is a small prograding beach; however, the adjacent coastal area is
topographically low and has been developed, so the exact amount of
progradation is obscured, although it does not appear to be large.
