Beginning about 3 km southwest of Dougall Point, in an embayment on the
east side of Hartstene Island, the northeast drift of this cell
terminates at a large recurved spit at Dougall Point.  Indicators of
northeasterly drift are sediment accumulated south of groins and logs,
numerous oblique bars migrating northeastward, widening and steepening
of the beach toward the terminus, and the recurved spit at the
terminus.  An addi-tion-al indicator is the northeastward drift of some
riprap boulders and large cobbles which had originally been placed
under a drainage culvert.  The lagoon within the spit was developed for
a marina; however, an attempt to keep open the channel with riprap has
proven ineffective and it is impassable by boat at low tide and little
better at high tide.
