From a divergence zone within the embayment in Section 25, this short
sector has net shore-drift to the southeast toward Fudge Point.  At the
divergence zone there is severe subaerial erosion of clay-rich bluffs.
Southeastward drift is indicated by accumulations of sediment northeast
of fallen trees.  Drift terminates at a convergence zone opposite the
end of a large recurved spit.
