Vaughn quad

This cell originates along a divergence zone in northeast Section 1
and terminates at a recurved spit at Fudge Point. Along the divergence 
zone the bluffs are nearly vertical and only partly vegetated.  
Northward they become less vertical and more vegetated, although they 
remain fairly steep along this segment.  Also northward, the low-tide 
terrace (sand flats) widens considerably.  There are several oblique bars 
upon the flats indicating transport to the north.  Also indicating 
northerly drift are sediment accumulations south of logs, a decrease 
of sediment size toward the north, and the recurved spit showing 
growth patterns from the south.
