Mason Lake quad

Drift in this very short sector is northward, into the westernmost cove
in Section 23, from a divergence zone immediately east of the cove.  At
the divergence zone there are a bluff and wave-cut platform.
Indicating drift to the north is a prograding lobe of sand migrating,
spit-like, into the cove.
