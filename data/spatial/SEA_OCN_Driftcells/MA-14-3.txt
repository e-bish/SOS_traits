Mason Lake quad

Net shore-drift along this sector originates immediately east of the
western-most cove in Section 23 and terminates in the next cove
eastward at a small spit building into the cove.  From a wave-cut
platform at the divergence zone, sediment size decreases to the sandy
spit, and the beach width and slope increase, indicating net
shore-drift in that direction.
