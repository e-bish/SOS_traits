Mason Lake quad

Drift in this very short sector is northward into the central of three
coves in Section 23, from a divergence zone immediately east of the
cove.  At the divergence zone are a bluff and wave-cut platform.
Indicating drift into the cove is a prograding lobe of sand migrating,
spit-like, northward.
