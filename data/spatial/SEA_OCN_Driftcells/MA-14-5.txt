Mason Lake quad

Drift along this sector begins at a divergence zone at the point of
land immediately east of the central cove in Section 23.  Net
shore-drift is to the northeast and terminates in the eastern-most cove
in Section 23.  There is a wave-cut platform and bluff at the
divergence zone and north-eastward from there the sediment-size grades
from cobbles and boulders to sand and pebbles.  Sand bars, migrating
into the cove, also indicate northeasterly net shore-drift.
