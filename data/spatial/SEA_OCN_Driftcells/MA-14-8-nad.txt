Mason Lake quad

About 200 meters west of the small cove in northwest section 26,
and for much of the shoreline along northern Section 27, 
the upper shore becomes a wave-cut platform with virtually no 
sediment upon it.  It is not an area of rapid erosion or active 
transport as barnacles and seaweed are attached to the till 
which forms the platform surface. Along the lower foreshore, 
there is gravel, but no indication that it is being transported
in any particular direction. Consequently, this area is characterized 
as having no appreciable net shore-drift.
