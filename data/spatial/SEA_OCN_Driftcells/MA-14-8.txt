Mason Lake quad

The westerly net shore-drift of this drift cell originates at a
divergence zone west of the entrance to Jarrell Cove.  There is an
unvegetated vertical bluff at the divergence zone.  A short distance
west, subaerial erosion predominates and the bluff has eroded back to
become a vegetated slope.  There is a general widening of the beach,
but it may be due more to the erodibility of the land than to sediment
transport along the shore, as there is a short section of sandy outwash
which, subaerially, erodes rapidly. At the tiny cove in northwest
Section 26, a wedge of sediment is being transported into the cove from
the east.  Some sediment appears to bypass this cove; however, in a
short distance, drift indicators become inconclusive.
