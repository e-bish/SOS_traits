Mason Lake quad

Originating at a divergence zone at the west side of the entrance to
Jarrell Cove, this southerly drift cell terminates a short distance
within Jarrell Cove.  Indicating southward drift, sediment size grades
from cobbly gravel at the divergence zone to sand and pebbles at a lobe
of sediment prograding into the cove.  In addition, there is an
increase in beach slope toward the terminus.
