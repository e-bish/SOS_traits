Longbranch quad

Beginning at a divergence zone, in northeastern Section 1, southerly
drift in this drift cell is indicated by sediment accumulations north
of logs, by sediment size decreasing southward, and by widening of the
beach.  This sector terminates at a complicated zone of convergence
from three directions, where an intertidal spit-platform connects
McMicken Island to Hartstene Island.
