Longbranch quad

This drift cell originates at the south end of McMicken Island along a
short divergence zone marked by a wave-cut platform.  Indicating
northeasterly drift is a gradational decrease of sediment size from
cobbles and boulders at the south end of the island to sand and pebbles
at the north-east end.  Some of the material is transported around the
point by wave refraction where it is deposited until northerly winds
and waves arise and cause continued sediment transport along this drift
cell in a southwestward direction.  The northern point of McMicken
Island is also a wave-cut platform and, excluding the wedge of sand and
pebbly material transported around the point, sediment is predominantly
cobbles and boulders.  The sediment-size grades southwestward to sand
at an intertidal spit-platform which connects McMicken Island to
Hartstene Island.
