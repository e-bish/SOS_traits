Longbranch quad

This short northwesterly sector begins at the wave-cut platform at the
south end of McMicken Island and terminates as it merges with the
spit-platform constructed predominantly by the southwestward transport
of the adjoining drift cell.  Indicating northwesterly drift is a rapid decrease
of sediment size in that direction, although the rapid transition may
be due in part to transport of material from the northeast around the
southwest point of the island.
