Longbranch quad

Originating at a divergence zone at Ballow (Section 12), northwesterly
net shore-drift is indicated by sediment accumulation south of
obstacles, and by a general decrease of sediment size to the
northwest.  This cell ends southwest of McMicken Island at a complex
convergent zone of drift from three directions.  When observed in
April, 1982, the spit-platform which marks the convergence of the 
McMicken Island drift cells and the drift cell to the north of the 
spit had a serpentine-form indicating a complex relationship between 
prevailing and predominant wind and wave energy in this area.
