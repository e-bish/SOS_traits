Longbranch quad

Drift in this sector is southeast from a divergence zone along Ballow
(Section 12) to a convergence zone in the Buffingtons Lagoon area.  Net
shore-drift indicators are a decrease of sediment size southeast-ward
and two small southeast-oriented spits.  The second of the two spits
marks the end of this cell and is opposed to a recurved spit
originating to the south-east.
