Longbranch quad

This long drift cell (9.5 km) begins at Brisco Point and terminates 
at a recurved spit at the point (Reno 2) in Section 7.  South of 
Wilson Point, net shore-drift is northeastward as indicated by 
accumulations of sediment south of obstacles (mainly logs), a 
decrease of sediment size to the northeast,an increase of  beach width 
and slope northeastward, numerous oblique bars migrating northeastward, 
and, at Wilson Point, a compound intertidal spit complex.
From Wilson Point, net shore-drift continues
in a northwesterly direction, as indicated by oblique bars oriented
northwestward, sediment accumulations south of obstacles, stream
diversions northwestward, and by the recurved spit at the terminus.
South of Wilson Point a stretch of the bluff consists of incohesive
sand which erodes rapidly.  Consequently, there is a relatively large
amount of sediment being added to and transported along this shore.  At
Wilson Point there is a change of shoreline orientation which results 
in a decrease in wave energy available for sediment transport. A considerable
amount of material is being deposited at Wilson Point, but there is still
sufficient energy available to continue transporting sediment northwestward, 
though at a lesser rate.
