Squaxin Island quad

Northward net shore-drift in this sector begins at the divergence
zone, southward-oriented point in Section 16. Northward net shore-drift
is indicated by sediment accumulations south of bulkheads, erosion to
the north of bulkheads, decreasing sediment-size northward, and
increasing beach width toward the north. Drift continues around the north
point of a small island (Section 9) and south into the cove behind the
island. At the northern end of the island a lobe of sediment is 
prograding around the point and southward into the cove.  During high 
tide sediment is washed into the cove from the east at the south end 
of the island.
