Squaxin Island quad

Northeastward drift from the Hartstene Island bridge is indicated by a
decrease in sediment size and an increase of the beach slope to the
northeast.  In addition, the drift cell terminus is marked by a spit
growing from the southwest into the cove in section 3 about 0.5 km
northeast of the bridge.
