Squaxin Island quad

Net shore-drift in this drift cell is northward from the north side of
the cove in Section 3 to an indistinct terminus zone in Section 27
where the shore orientation curves to the northeast.  Evidence of
northward drift includes sediment accumulated to the south of logs and
bulkheads, erosion north of bulkheads, a sediment size decrease
northward, oblique bars oriented to the north, and northerly diversion
of small streams.  Northward, beyond a small stream mouth in southern
Section 27, there are no apparent indicators of net shore-drift for a
stretch of about 1 km.
