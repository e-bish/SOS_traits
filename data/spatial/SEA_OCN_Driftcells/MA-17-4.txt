Squaxin Island quad

Four very small drift cells originate at the small southwest-oriented
points within the embayment south of Graham Point.  Net shore-drift in
all four is generally northward into the two small coves.  The points
are wave-cut platforms littered with cobbles and boulders, while finer
sediment is transported into the coves.  The overall effect will be
eventual straightening of the shore within the embayment.
