Squaxin Island quad

Beginning about 250 m southwest of the Hartstene Island bridge, drift
in the cell is northeasterly and terminates at the bridge footings
which extend into deep water.  Sediment size increases from the bridge
to the wave-cut platform at the small point to the southwest,
indicating net shore-drift toward the northeast.
