Squaxin Island, Mason Lake quads

Drift in this section is northerly, from the Hartstene Island bridge to
the southern-most of two small coves about 2 km to the north  (Section
34). Immediately north of the bridge footings, beach erosion is
occurring and there is a cobble-gravel lag on the wave-cut platform.
Sediment size decreases northward indicating drift in that direction.
Also indicating net shore-drift to the north are a small,
northward-prograding spit at Graham Point, sediment accumulated to the
south of bulkheads, and at the terminus, another small spit recurved
into the cove.
