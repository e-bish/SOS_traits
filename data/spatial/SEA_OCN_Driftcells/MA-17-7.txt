Mason Lake quad

This sector begins between the two small coves in Section 34 and ends
within the northern-most of the coves.  Northward drift is indicated
by a decrease of sediment size in that direction.  Drift continues
around the point, which is a wave-cut platform, and ends at a small
spit prograding southwesterly into the cove.
