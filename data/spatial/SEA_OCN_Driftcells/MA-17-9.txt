Mason Lake quad

Beginning at a divergence zone in northwest Section 34, net shore-drift
in this sector is northward and terminates in the cove between Walkers
Landing and Sun Point.  Geomorphic indicators of northward drift are
sediment accumulations to the south of obstacles (logs, groins, boat
ramp), an increase of beach width and decrease of sediment size
northward, and the northward diversion of a small stream.
