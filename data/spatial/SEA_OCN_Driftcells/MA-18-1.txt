Squaxin Island quad

Beginning at a divergence zone at the point on the north side of the
entrance to Hammersley Inlet, net shore-drift along this sector is
northward. Indicating northward drift is a transition of bluff morphology
from a steep, non-vegetated bluff at the divergence zone to more
gentle, vegetated slopes to the north.  In addition, there are a few
oblique bars and a small spit oriented northward, sediment accumulations 
to the south of logs, groins and bulkheads, widening of the beach 
northwestward, steepening of the beach slope to the northeast, and fining of the
sediment northwestward.  This sector terminates at the stream mouth in
southern Section 16.
