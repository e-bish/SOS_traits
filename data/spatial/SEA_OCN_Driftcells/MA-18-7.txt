Squaxin Island quad

This drift cell originates at an eroding divergence zone in Section
15.  Net sediment transport is toward the east and terminates with a
spit-like lobe of sediment converging with drift from the southeast 
within a small cove.  There is a sediment size decrease into the 
cove from the divergence zone.
