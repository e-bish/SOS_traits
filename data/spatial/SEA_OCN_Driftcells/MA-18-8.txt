Squaxin Island quad

Originating at a divergence zone in central Section 15, net shore-drift
of this sector is toward the north, terminating at the footings
of the Hartstene Island bridge which extends into deep water.  
Northwestward drift is indicated by accumulations of sediment southeast 
of logs and tree roots; by a size decrease of sediment; by small 
northwest-oriented spits diverting stream drainages; and by oblique 
bars migrating northwestward. In addition, the beach is prograding 
outward along the south side of the footings of the bridge.
