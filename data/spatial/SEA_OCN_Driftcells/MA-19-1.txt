Shelton, Squaxin Island quads

Net shore-drift in this segment begins at a divergence zone at the
boundary between Sections 11 and 12, and continues northeast almost 
to Cape Cod. From northeast Section 1, across Section 6 to Windy Point,
bluff instability is evidenced by small slides and fallen and leaning trees.
Indicators of northeasterly drift are northeastward stream diversions 
accumulated sediment on the southwest sides of obstacles; oblique bars 
migrating to the northeast; and a sand spit in Section 28 oriented 
toward the northeast.  Although some material is trapped at the spit,
net shore-drift continues northeastward.  There is a sediment size 
decrease to the northeast from the spit.  Also, sediment accumulations 
occur southwest of groins, bulkheads and a boat ramp.  
A spectacular example of a net shore-drift
indicator occurs northwest of the point at Arcadia, indicating drift to
the northwest.  A wall, extending from the backshore, above high water
level, extends across the beach to the lower foreshore.  The top of the
wall remains level, so that at the lower foreshore end it is about 4 m
high.  The result is about 2 m of vertical offset and 30-40 m of 
horizontal offset of the beach. Drift along this sector terminates about
0.3 km southeast where a glacial till bluff extends out into deep water.
