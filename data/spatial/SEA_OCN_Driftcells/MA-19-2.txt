Squaxin Island quad

This drift cell extends between two glacial headlands along the south
shore of Hammersley Inlet.  Eastward drift begins along central
section 20 and terminates about 0.3 km west of Cape Cod.  Slight
sediment accumulation west of fallen trees suggests eastward drift.
Strong tidal influences in Hammersley Inlet obscure shore-drift
indicators along much of the inlet, especially at the headlands which
are essentially swept clear of sediment.  Hammersley Inlet is narrow
and sinuous, resulting in a normally low-energy wave environment.
There are, however, some indicators of shore-drift, although relatively
minor compared to much of the rest of southern Puget Sound in Mason
County.
