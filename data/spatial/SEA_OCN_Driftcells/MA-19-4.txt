Squaxin Island quad

This sector originates at approximately the western boundary of this
map, along the north shore of Hammersley Inlet, and terminates to the
east at a cove in central Section 20.  Indicating eastward drift are
slight sediment accumulations west of logs, an increase of beach width
eastward, and a lobe of sediment being transported into the cove from
the west.
