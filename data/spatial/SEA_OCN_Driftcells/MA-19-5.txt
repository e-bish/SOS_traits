Squaxin Island quad

Originating immediately east of a small cove in central Section 20, net
shore-drift along this sector is eastward, terminating at Cape Horn.
From a vertical, non-vegetated bluff at the origin, the bluffs become
less steep and more vegetated eastward.  A thin layer of gravelly
sediment veneers a wave-cut platform at the origin.  Eastward there is
a decrease in sediment size and the beach width increases, indicating
easterly drift.  Cape Horn, at the terminus of this drift cell, is an
extremely unstable feature.  Active landsliding is occurring at the
point of the horn.  Wave and tidal action remove debris from the toe of
the slide, keeping it active.
