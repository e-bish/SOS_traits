Squaxin Island quad

Generally westward drift in this sector begins at a divergence zone
located at the point on the north side of the entrance to Hammersley
Inlet (Hungerford Point) and terminates at Cape Horn which extends into
deep water.  Westward drift is indicated by a gradational sediment size
decrease westward, accumulated sediment to the east of obstacles, and
an increase in beach width to the west.
