Squaxin Island quad

From a wave-cut platform divergence zone at the southeast portion of
Hope Island, drift in this sector is to the west and converges with
drift from the north along the southwest shore of the island.  There is
a decrease of sediment size and widening of the beach to the west,
evidence of net shore-drift in that direction.
