Squaxin Island quad

Originating at a divergence zone along the southeast shore of Hope
Island, drift is northward to the north end of the island, where some
sediment is transported around the point by wave refraction.  From the
north end, net shore-drift is southward along the west shore of the
island where it terminates with convergence of drift at the southwest
shore.  Indicators of drift are size decrease of sediment from
southeast to north, then again from north to southwest, and sediment
accumulated to the south of obstacles on the eastern shore and to the
north of obstacles on the western shore.
