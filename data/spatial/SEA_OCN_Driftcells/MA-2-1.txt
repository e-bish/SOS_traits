Elson quad

This drift cell extends across the delta of Waketickeh Creek in Section
23.  Northeastward drift is indicated by accumulations of sediment
south of obstacles.  The creek appears to have originally been diverted
northward but it has been artificially channelized and the delta,
altered by development, obscures the original configuration.  At both
ends of the sector are cliffs of basalt which prevent appreciable
sediment bypass.
