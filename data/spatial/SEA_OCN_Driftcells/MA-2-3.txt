Eldon quad

Originating at a divergence zone in Section 3, drift in this sector is
northward, continuing to the mouth of the Hamma Hamma River.
North from the divergence zone the pebbly upper foreshore widens
considerably.  The bluff of outwash material along this sector is
protected at its base by riprap which retards bluff erosion.  This
diminishes the quantity of sediment available to form the beaches
which, in turn, may result in increased erosion downdrift or removal of
the beach material.
Jorsted Creek, in Section 34, is diverted northward. A sandy prograding 
beach is developing on the south side of the delta of the stream and several
sand bars are moving up onto the delta from the south. North of the stream
delta the beach is narrow and the sediment coarse. The beach widens 
northward and the sediment size decreases until the south side of the Hamma 
Hamma River delta where a sandy prograding beach is developing, similar to
the one at Jorsted Creek, and again numerous bars are moving up the delta.
Drift terminates at the present river channel which has been channelized 
with long riprap jetties that truncate old spits and which originally
diverted the river northward.
