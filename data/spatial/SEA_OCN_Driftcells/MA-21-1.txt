Summit Lake quad

This cell originates at a divergence zone along the New Kamilche area 
and terminates at Deepwater Point. In southwest Section 21, oyster shells 
dumped by a commercial oyster firm have been reworked into a spit-shaped 
form oriented toward the northeast. Other geomorphic indicators of easterly 
net shore-drift are a decrease in sediment size to the east, sediment 
accumulated to the west of obstacles, oblique bars migrating eastward, 
and two small spits (Sections 22 and 23) diverting streams in an 
easterly direction.  In addition, the beach slope and width increase 
toward the terminus at a small, prograding, lobate beachform at Deepwater Point.
