Shelton quad

Originating at a divergence zone immediately north of Big Cove (Section
14), southward drift in this sector is indicated by a decrease of
sediment size southward, diversion of a small stream toward the south,
increases of beach width and slope toward the terminus, and sediment
accumulations to the north of logs.  This sector terminates at a
small, lobate beachform at Deepwater Point where it converges with
drift from the west.
