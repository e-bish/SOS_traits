Shelton quad

This short drift cell begins near Big Cove (Section 14) and ends at a
small, prograding convergence zone in northeast Section 14.  Sediment
size reduction northward, sediment accumulations to the south of logs,
beach slope and width increases northward, and diversion of a small
stream northward indicate net shore-drift to the north.
