Southward net shore-drift of this sector originates at a divergence
zone along Section 11 and terminates at a prograding zone of drift
convergence in northeast Section 14.  Southerly drift is shown by
widening and steepening of the beach to the south, size decrease of
sediment southward, and sediment accumulated to the north of
obstacles.
