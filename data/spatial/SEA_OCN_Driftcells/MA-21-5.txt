This drift cell begins along a divergence zone in Section 11 and ends
to the north around Kamilche Point and into Wildcat Cove.  Indicating
northward net shore-drift are sediment accumulations south of
obstacles, a decrease of sediment size northward, and an increase of
beach width north to Kamilche Point.
