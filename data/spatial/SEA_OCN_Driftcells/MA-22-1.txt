Summit Lake quad

Southwestward drift along this short sector in the New Kamilche area is
indicated by a muddy, spit-like diversion of a small stream toward the
southwest.  The origin of this drift cell is along a divergence zone at
approximately the boundary between Sections 28 and 29.  

Note: The southwest end of Oyster Bay is characterized by NANSD.  It is 
an area of progradation where the sediment influx of the two small streams 
combine in a deltaic marsh and mudflat environment.
