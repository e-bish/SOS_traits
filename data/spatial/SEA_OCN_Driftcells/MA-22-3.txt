Shelton quad

Beginning in northwest Section 16, drift along this sector is indicated
by sediment accumulations southwest of obstacles and the northeasterly
diversion of small streams by small mud spits. This area is mostly 
shallow mudflat and a very low-energy wave environment prevails.
The sector terminates near the boundary of Sections 9 and 10, where 
tidal influences begin to dominate the shore environment.
