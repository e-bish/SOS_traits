Shelton quad

This sector begins at approximately the boundary between Sections 9
and 16 on the northwest shore of Skookum Inlet and ends where tidal 
currents begin to dominate the shore configuration at approximately 
the boundary of Sections 9 and 10.
Sediment accumulated to the south of obstacles and the diversion of
small streams north-eastward indicate northeasterly net shore-drift.
No appreciable net shore drift characterizes the southwest end of 
Skookum Inlet which is a shallow, muddy, prograding deltaic area.
