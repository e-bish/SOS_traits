Shelton quad

Beginning a short distance to the northeast of Shelton in Section 18,
northeasterly net shore-drift is indicated by sediment accumulations
southwest of logs, groins, and bulkheads; sediment-size decrease toward
the northeast; an increase of beach width and slope in a northeasterly 
direction; oblique bars which are migrating northeastward; the 
development of a small looped-bar by sediment transport from the
southwest, and, near the terminus, a spit oriented toward the
northeast.  This sector terminates along the south shore of Bayshore at the mouth 
of Johns Creek which has deposited long gravel levees onto its deltaic 
tide flats.
