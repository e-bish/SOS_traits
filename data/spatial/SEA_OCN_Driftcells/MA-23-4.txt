Shelton, Union quads

This drift cell originates at a divergence zone in central Section 10,
and terminates near the northeast end of Oakland Bay.  Indicators of
northeastward net shore-drift are a northeasterly prograding spit,
sediment accumulated southwest of groins, bulkheads and logs, and a
decrease of sediment size toward the northeast.  Drift indicators cease
along the tide flats in northwest Section 2.  In central Section 2,
there is considerable subaerial erosion of the slopes as indicated by
leaning and fallen trees and several small slides across the shore.
