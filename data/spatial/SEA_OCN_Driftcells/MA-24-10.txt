Squaxin Island quad

From a divergence zone in southwest Section 19, drift is southwestward
around a small cove to Libby Point where it terminates at a till
headland which extends into deep water.  Indicating southwesterly
drift, the beach widens in that direction, and a small stream is
diverted somewhat south-westward.
