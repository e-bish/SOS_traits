Squaxin Island quad

Net shore-drift in this section is eastward from a divergence zone in
southwest Section 19 and terminates a short distance east of a small
cove where a glacial till headland extends into deep water.  A lobe of
sediment, transported from the west, diverts drainage eastward at the
cove.
