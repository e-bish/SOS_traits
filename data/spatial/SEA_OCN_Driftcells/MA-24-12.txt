Squaxin Island quad

This segment along the south shore of Hammersley Inlet begins at a
glacial till headland in northern Section 30 and ends west of a till 
headland midway along Section 20. Eastward drift is indicated
by sediment accumulation to the west of logs and a widening of the
beach to the east.
