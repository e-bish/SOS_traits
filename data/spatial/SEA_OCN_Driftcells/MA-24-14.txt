Squaxin Island quad

Originating southeast of Skookum Point, drift in this section is
southeastward, terminating at the mouth of Mill Creek (Section 25). A
general widening of the beach, a small stream diverted somewhat
southeast, and a lobe of sediment oriented to the southeast at the
mouth of Mill Creek indicate southeastward drift.
