Shelton quad

This sector commences in the Walker Park area (Section 21). Drift along
this portion of the southern shore of Hammersley Inlet is eastward as
indicated by sediment accumulated west of groins, logs, and bulkheads,
and by slight stream diversions.  Net shore-drift terminates west of
Skookum Point, a glacial till headland which extends into deep water.
