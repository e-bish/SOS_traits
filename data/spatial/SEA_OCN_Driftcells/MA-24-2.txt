Beginning a short distance to the northeast of Shelton in Section 18,
northeasterly net shore-drift is indicated by sediment accumulations
southwest of logs, groins, and bulkheads, sediment-size decrease toward
the northeast, an increase of beach width in a northeasterly direction,
and oblique bars which are migrating northeastward.  This segment is
continued in the next map area (see Map MA-23, Segment 23-1).
