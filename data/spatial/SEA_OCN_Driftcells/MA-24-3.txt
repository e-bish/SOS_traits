Shelton quad

Originating at a divergence zone northwest of Chapman Cove, net
shore-drift in this sector is toward the southeast, terminating at a
spit growing to the southeast into Chapman Cove.  From a cobble beach
on a wave-cut platform at the divergence zone, sediment-size decreases
to the spit at the terminus, indicating drift in a southeasterly
direction.  In addition, the bluff undergoes a transition from vertical
and non-vegetated at the divergence zone, to a gentle, vegetated slope
near the terminus.
