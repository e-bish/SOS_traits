Shelton quad

This drift cell begins at a divergence zone at Munson Point, and ends
at a spit oriented to the northeast into Chapman Cove.  Northeastward
net shore-drift is indicated by accumulated sediment on the southwest
sides of logs, groins, and bulkheads, an increase of beach width toward
the northeast, a small looped bar prograding northeasterly, several
oblique bars oriented toward the northeast, and the terminal spit.
