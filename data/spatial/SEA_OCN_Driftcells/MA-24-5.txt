Shelton quad

From a divergence zone at Munson Point, net shore-drift in this sector
is southeast around Miller Point, then eastward to a small embayment
located east of Church Point in Section 24.  Where not protected by
bulkheads, the bluff between Munson Point and Miller Point is eroding
relatively rapidly. Indicating eastward drift are sediment
accumulations to the west of bulkheads and groins, erosion to the east
of bulkheads, and a few bars migrating eastward.  There does not appear
to be a great quantity of sediment transport along the shore of
Hammersley Inlet, although there are a few indicators of some net
shore-drift.
