Southeastward drift from the divergence zone in Section 3 to Ayock
Point is indicated by a slight accumulation of sediment northwest of a
boat ramp at the Ayock Point development and by a size decrease of the
sediment with a corresponding increase of beach slope.  Ayock Point is
a cuspate spit formed as a result of drift cell convergence from the
north and south.
