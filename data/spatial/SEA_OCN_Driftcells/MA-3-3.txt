Eldon, Lilliwaup quads

Beginning at a divergence zone on the north side of Lilliwaup Bay,
drift along this 7 km drift cell is northeastward and continues to 
Ayock Point.  Net shore-drift toward the northeast is indicated by sediment
accumulations southwest of numerous logs, groins, and bulkheads,
by a decrease of sediment size and beach widening northeastward, and by the
development of a sandy prograding beach on the south edge of the Eagle
Creek delta (Section 16). 
At the north side of the entrance to Lilliwaup Bay, a wave-cut platform 
is exposed through a thin layer of cobbles and boulders.  
The base of the bluff along the southern segment of this cell is armored 
with riprap in an attempt to prevent erosion and stabilize the steep 
upper slopes which have frequently failed.
At Eagle Creek the highway is built upon what appears to
have been a spit which had enclosed a lagoon and diverted streamflow
northward.  In addition, there is a small spit immediately south of
Ayock Point which diverts stream drainage northward.  Deltaic
deposition by the stream has formed a wide tideland south of Ayock
Point, whereas on the north side, the beach descends steeply to a good
small boat anchorage. Consequently, even though more material may move
to the point from the south, the north side is more typical of the
cuspate spit model.
