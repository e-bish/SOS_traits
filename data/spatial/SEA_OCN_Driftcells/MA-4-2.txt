Lilliwaup quad

This drift cell is within Lilliwaup Bay, extending from the divergence
zone along the north side of the bay entrance to the highway bridge at
the head of the bay.  Drift northwest into the bay is indicated by a
sediment size decrease and a slowly prograding beach on the bay-side of
the highway bridge footing.  Lilliwaup Bay originally extended farther
inland, but construction of the bridge has isolated the portion west of
the highway and it is not now affected by shore-drift.  The Lilliwaup
River delta, above the bridge, appears to be filling in with sediment
at a rapid rate.
