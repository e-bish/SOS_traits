Lilliwaup quad

Beginning at the delta of Sund Creek (Section 31), drift in this sector
is toward the north and terminates at Lilliwaup Bay.  Sediment accumulations 
south of groins in the delta area indicate northerly drift.  In addition, 
distinctive shale fragments from beds exposed along the northern portion 
of section 31 become gradationally smaller northward. The terminus is 
marked by a slowly prograding beach developing at the south side of 
the highway bridge footings at the head of Lilliwaup Bay.
