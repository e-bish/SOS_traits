Lilliwaup quad

Southeastward drift of this cell begins at a divergence zone at the
point on the north side of the entrance to Dewatto Bay and ends at a
spit just over 0.5 km into the bay.  The beach widens southeastward
from the divergence zone, sediment becomes generally finer, and the
beach slope increases to the spit.  Also indicating southeastward drift
are sediment accumulations on the northwest sides of logs.
