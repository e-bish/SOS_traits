Drift to the northeast in this sector originates at the divergence
zone on the north side of Dewatto Bay and terminates in Kitsap County.  
The total length of the drift cell is about 8 km.  Drift indicators
include sediment accumulations southwest of obstacles and northeastward
diversion of small streams.  The beach is generally narrow and cobbly. 
Slopes bordering the shore are generally steep, well vegetated, and 
unstable. Devegetation by wave erosion below, or development above, 
promotes rapid sub-aerial erosion as evidenced by numerous leaning and 
fallen trees along the beach.
Along the southern part of Sections 14 and 15, a thin
layer of cobbly sediment overlies a wave-cut platform which, in places,
is exposed. Along the northern part of Section 11 and southern part of Section 2,
considerable failure of incohesive glacial outwash bluffs is
occurring.  This is primarily subaerial erosion and not due to wave
erosion of the lower bluff.  It seems to have been accelerated here by
the attempted construction of numerous access roads to the beach.
However, in some places, more resistant till overlies the glacial
outwash and as the outwash erodes away, more or less continuously, the
till forms overhangs which give way en masse only occasionally.
Where the shoreline curves to the northeast in section 2, a berm begins to 
build up, becoming more pronounced to the north. A small stream at this point
is diverted northward about 20 m, also indicating northerly drift. The beach 
continues to widen and the sediment decreases in sizer northward into Kitsap 
County.
