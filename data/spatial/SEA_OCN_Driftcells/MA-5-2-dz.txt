Hoodsport quad

For about 1.5 km along the shore in the Hoodsport area, no clear 
shore-drift pattern emerges.  Sediment accumulations are on either 
or both ends of bulkheads.  Whether this is partly due to waterfront 
development obscuring drift indicators or entirely because of an 
unusually lengthy divergence zone is unclear.
