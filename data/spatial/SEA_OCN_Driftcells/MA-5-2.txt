Lilliwaup, Hoodsport quads

This drift cell begins in the Hoodsport area and continues north
approximately 3.2 km.  For about 1.5 km along the shore in the 
Hoodsport area, no clear shore-drift pattern emerges.  
Sediment accumulations are on either or both ends of bulkheads.  
Whether this is partly due to waterfront development obscuring drift 
indicators or entirely because of an unusually lengthy divergence zone 
is unclear.  However, there are clear indicators that north of 
Hoodsport net shore-drift is toward the north and at a short 
distance south of Hoodsport drift is toward the south. 
North of Finch Creek (Section 12), sediment accumulation occurs at 
the south end of a bulkhead and the beach is eroding at the north end. 
The beach sediment, from north of Hoodsport to section 1, is primarily
boulders and cobbles with the exception of a small pebbly delta at the
mouth of an intermittent stream (at BM9).  Here there is an
accumulation of pebbles piled against the south side of a culvert.  
Much of the shore along Section 1 is riprap and fill pushed onto the
foreshore.  A narrow beach is exposed at low tide, but other than a
small accumulation of sediment at the south end of the bulkhead, there
are no good geomorphic drift indicators along this stretch.  North of
Miller Creek, sediment accumulations occur on the south sides of
several groins and a small stream about 400 m north of Miller Creek is
diverted northward.  A further indication of northerly drift is the
sediment size decrease along the beach which marks the terminus of this
cell. The drift cell terminates at the  southwest corner of Section 31 
where it is blocked by an outcrop of rock of the Crescent Formation.
