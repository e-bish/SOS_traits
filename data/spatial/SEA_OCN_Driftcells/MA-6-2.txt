Hoodsport, Skokomish Valley quads

Originating at the divergence zone in the Hoodsport area, net
shore-drift in this sector is southward and terminates at a discharge
channel dredged from the Tacoma City Light hydroelectric generating
station located 1 km south of Potlatch on the Skokomish Indian
Reservation. Southerly drift is indicated by a slight southward 
diversion of Hill Creek (Section 14), a southward decrease of sediment 
size, accumulation of sediment north of groins, and a spit-like 
accreting beach oriented to the south at Potlatch.  In addition, 
south of Potlatch, a sand bar is building up against the
north side of a row of pilings.
