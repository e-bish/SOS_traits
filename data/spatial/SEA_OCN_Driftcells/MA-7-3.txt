Union quad

Drift in this short cell is southward, originating at a divergence
zone at approximately the boundary between Sections 31 and 6, south of
the town of Union.  Sediment accumulations north of bulkheads and a
boat ramp indicate drift to the south.  Within a short distance,
shore-drift is obscured by the influence of flow from the Skokomish
River.
