Union quad

This segment originates at a divergence zone about 1 km south of the
town of Union.  Northward drift is indicated by accumulation of
sediment south of groins and bulkheads, and by oyster-shell bars which
are migrating northward from a commercial oyster site.  Drift continues
around the point at Union becoming easterly, as evidenced by sediment
size decrease and accumulation of sediment west of groins, bulkheads,
and boat ramps.  Also, east of Union, the beach widens somewhat.
Drift terminates at a pebbly prograding beach northwest of a small stream 
in Section 33.
