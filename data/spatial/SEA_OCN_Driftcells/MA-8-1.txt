Net shore-drift, beginning at the divergence zone at Ayres Point, is
eastward in this cell.  Indicating easterly drift are accumulations of sediment
west of bulkheads, beach erosion east of bulkheads, and widening of the
beach to the east.  In Section 29 a pebbly prograding beach 
diverts a small stream eastward.  East of the stream the beach is 
eroded and then it widens again farther east. Shore-drift in this cell
 terminates at Tahuya fairly large, developed prograding area at the 
mouth of the Tahuya River.
