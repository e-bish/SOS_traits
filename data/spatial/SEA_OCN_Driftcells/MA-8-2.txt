Union quad

Northerly shore-drift of this drift cell begins at a divergence zone
located about 1 km northwest of Sisters Point and terminates at a spit
oriented northward into the mouth of the Tahuya River.  Evidence of
northerly drift includes widening of the beach and increase of the
beach slope northward to the terminal spit.  Also, sediment
accumulations south of numerous groins and bulkheads indicate drift to
the north.
