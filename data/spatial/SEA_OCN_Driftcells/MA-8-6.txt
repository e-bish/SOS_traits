Mason Lake  Union quads

This drift cell  begins at a divergence zone in central Section 33. Net
shore-drift is eastward as evidenced by sediment accumulations west of
groins, boat ramps, and bulkheads, by widening of the beach eastward,
and by oblique bars oriented toward the east. Southwest of Twanoh State 
Park, fragments of asphalt fill are traceable to the northeast, 
several tens of meters, from the fill site.  At Twanoh State Park 
a large boat ramp has blocked shore-drift from the southwest, resulting 
in nearly 2 m of vertical offset of the shore and more than 15 m of 
horizontal offset.  Northeast of the boat ramp, erosion appears severe 
despite the placement of riprap.  Net shore-drift terminates at Twanoh 
where it converges with drift from the east.
