Union quad

Easterly net shore-drift in this segment begins west of Sisters Point
 and terminates at a convergence zone at a small prograding lobate 
beachform where the shoreline curves to the northeast in Section 26.  
Easterly drift indicators are a sediment size decrease; increase of 
the slope and width of the beach to the convergence zone; and 
accumulations of sediment west of numerous groins and bulkheads, 
as well as erosion east of many of those structures.
