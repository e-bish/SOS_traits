Union quad

Originating at a divergence zone on the east side of Section 26 and
terminating at a convergence zone about 0.5 km to the southwest, net
shore-drift in this cell is indicated by sediment accumulations
northeast of groins and bulkheads, by erosion southwest of these
obstacles, by the beach widening to the southwest, and an increase in
the beach slope and decrease of sediment size to the southwest.
