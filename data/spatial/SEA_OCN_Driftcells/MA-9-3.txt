Union quad

Net shore-drift in this sector is northeast from a divergence zone at
central-east Section 26 to a convergence zone at a prograding lobate
beachform in northeast Section 26.  Geomorphic indicators of net
shore-drift to the northeast are a widening of the beach from the
divergence zone to the convergence zone, a northeasterly decrease of
sediment size, a steepening of the beach slope to the convergence
zone, and accumulations of sediment southwest and beach erosion
northeast of groins and bulkheads.
