Lilliwaup, Union quads

This drift cell originates at a divergence zone at the southeast
corner of Section 23 and terminates a short distance to the south at a
prograding lobate beachform in northeast Section 26.  Southerly drift
is indicated by widening of the beach southward, accumulations of
sediment north of obstacles, and sediment size decreasing to the
convergence zone.
