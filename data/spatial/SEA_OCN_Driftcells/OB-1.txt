Blakely Island quad

The origin of this cell is located 200 m northwest of the eastern tip of Obstruction Island.  A rocky coast is present here with cliff erosion yielding a limited amount of drift material.  Net shore-drift is to the northwest for 400 m, along a concave beach that faces Obstruction Pass.  Drift material accumulates against a rocky prominence at the northwest end of the beach.  Evidence of northwestward net shore-drift is the accumulation of drift sediment located on the southeast side of the rock prominence, and northwestward beach width increase and sediment size decrease.
