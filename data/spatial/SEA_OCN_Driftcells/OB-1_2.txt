Blakely Island quad

No appreciable net shore-drift occurs along the eastern and southeastern shores of Obstruction Island at Peavine Pass.  The rocky coast that is present here is resistent to erosion and no glacial deposits are located alongshore, resulting in very minimal sediment volumes, present in several small pocket beaches along the southeast coast.  No appreciable net shore-drift occurs along the southwest extension of Obstruction Island, until a point approximately 0.8 km from the southwest tip of the island.
