Blakely Island quad

This 200-m-long drift cell has its origin at a zone of drift divergence and has southward net shore-drift along a fairly linear beach.  A minimal volume of sediment, that is derived from erosion of a greywacke and siltstone cliff, is transported by northwesterly waves from East Sound in this cell.  Net shore-drift indicators include a decrease in sediment size and increased beach width to the south, and accumulation of sediment on the north side of the rock prominence delineating the terminus of the cell.
