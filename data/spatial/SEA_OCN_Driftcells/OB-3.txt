Blakely Island quad

This is a short (0.6 km) cell found along western Obstruction Island with northward net shore-drift.  The cell origin is found at a zone of drift divergence where an eroding cliff comprised of greywacke and siltstone serves as the sediment source.  A narrow, coarse gravel beach is present here.  Moving north along the cell the beach becomes wider and is comprised of sand and pebbles, indicating net shore-drift in that direction.  The terminus of the cell is at the northern end of the sandy beach that abuts a large rocky prominence near the northern tip of the island, interrupting net shore-drift.
