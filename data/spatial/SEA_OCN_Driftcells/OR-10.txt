Eastsound quad

The origin of this cell is located 4.5 km due south of the town of Eastsound along rocky shore.  Along with cliff erosion, glacial outwash deposits located several hundred meters inland of the origin of the cell are a probable sediment source, transported to the coast by streams.  Net shore-drift is to the north for 1.5 km, at which point drift material accumulates on a southeast-facing shore sector. Evidence of northward net shore-drift are drift sediment accumulations located on the south side of rock outcrops, and northward beach width increase and sediment size decrease to the north.
