Eastsound, Blakely Island, Shaw Island quads

No appreciable net shore-drift occurs along the central and southern portions of the western shore of East Sound (Eastsound and Blakely Island quadrangles) and along most of Harney Channel (Shaw Island quadrangle), down to an area of southern Orcas Island that is directly across from Point Hudson on Shaw Island.  The rocky coast is resistent to erosion and no glacial deposits are located alongshore.  There are numerous pocket beaches present along this coast, including White Beach, Guthrie Cove, and Grindstone Harbor.
