Shaw Island quad

A pair of net shore-drift cells occur on opposite sides of a small, former island that is now connected to Orcas Island by a double tombolo.  Net shore-drift in this cell originates from the eroding rocky shore within the 300 m zone east of the tombolo and has westward net shore-drift. Net shore-drift is evidenced by beach width increase and sediment size decrease towards the former island in both cells, and by the southward progradation of the double tombolo.
