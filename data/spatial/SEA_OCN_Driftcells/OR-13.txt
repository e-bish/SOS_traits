Shaw Island quad

This cell originates in front of the town of Orcas, immediately west of the state ferry dock.  Net shore-drift passes beneath the ferry dock to the east, to the entrance of the small cove/marina 0.5 km east of Orcas.  Bluffs composed of glacial till, sand, and gravel serve as the sediment source for this cell and are found along the length of the cell.  Beach sediment is mixed near the origin of the cell, consisting of boulders, finer gravel, and some sand.  Sediment becomes finer to the east, consisting of pebbles and sand along the jetty fronting the marina.  Beach width increases to the east, reaching a maximum at the jetty, as drift material accumulates west of this object partially interrupting drift, evidencing eastward net shore-drift.  A large accumulation of drift logs is also located at the base of the jetty.  

No appreciable net shore-drift occurs along the rocky eastern shore of West Sound from the town of Orcas to the west and north to the town of West Sound (East Sound quadrangle).  Isolated small beaches are found along this stretch but no continuous shore drift occurs along this sector.  A stream delta is found in Whits Beach Bay that may contribute sediment to the immediate area, but the area has been substantially modified by the addition of a causeway developed for a log transport facility, such that natural net shore-drift indicators are obscured. Further north a marina development has modified natural indicators, resulting in an area of continued no appreciable net shore-drift.
