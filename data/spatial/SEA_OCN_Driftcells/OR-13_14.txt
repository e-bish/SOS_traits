Shaw Island, Eastsound quads

No appreciable net shore-drift occurs along the rocky eastern shore of West Sound from the town of Orcas to the west and north to the town of West Sound (East Sound quadrangle).  Isolated small beaches are found along this stretch but no continuous shore drift occurs along this sector.  A stream delta is found in Whits Beach Bay that may contribute sediment to the immediate area, but the area has been substantially modified by the addition of a causeway developed for a log transport facility, such that natural net shore-drift indicators are obscured. Further north a marina development has modified natural indicators, resulting in an area of continued no appreciable net shore-drift.
