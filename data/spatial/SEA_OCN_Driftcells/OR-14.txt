Eastsound quad

This 300 m net shore-drift cell originates 0.5 km east of Haida Point with eastward net shore-drift to the mouth of the Crow River. Immediately east of Haida Point there is a small pocket beach and a short segment of rocky shore devoid of a beach, where no appreciable net shore-drift occurs.  The sediment source for this cell is a low-elevation glacial till deposit at the origin of the cell.  Eastward net shore-drift is evidenced by a decrease in sediment grain size and increase in beach width to the east.  A large accumulation of beach sediment is located on the western side of a rip-rap breakwater constructed in front of a building that extends onto the beach approximately 150 m west of the mouth of the Crow River, further evidencing eastward net shore-drift.  Additional evidence is found in the eastward diversion of the Crow River as it crosses the intertidal zone.  The accumulation of sediment prograding around the rip-rap structure and the sediment diverting the Crow River constitute the terminus of this cell.
