The origin of this cell is found north of a zone of no appreciable net shore-drift that extends 0.5 km north from Haida Point.  The sediment source for this cell is glacial drift that intermittently overlies Paleozoic-aged crystalline rocks.  Net shore-drift is to the northwest for 1.5 km into Massacre Bay.  Beach width increases and sediment size decreases to the northwest as far as a sandy beach located approximately half way up the bay.  Accumulations of drift material are found on the southeastern side of rock outcrops here, also evidencing northwestward net shore-drift.  Net shore-drift continues beyond this beach and the upper shore of Massacre Bay experiences a second progressive increase in beach width and decrease in sediment size (with some of the sand lost to deeper water) to the northwest.  The terminus of the cell is located at two adjacent, wide beaches north-northeast of Skull Island near the head of the bay.
