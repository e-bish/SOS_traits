Eastsound quad

No appreciable net shore-drift occurs along the entire western shores of Massacre Bay and West Sound.  Very little sediment is available along this rocky and irregularly shaped coast.  Numerous pocket beaches do occur, however.  The south end of the peninsula, separating West Sound from Deer Harbor, and the southern 1.5 km of the eastern entrance to Deer Harbor also exhibit no appreciable net shore-drift (Shaw Island quadrangle).
