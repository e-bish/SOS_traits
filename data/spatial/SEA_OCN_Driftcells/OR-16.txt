Shaw Island, Friday Harbor quads

This cell originates immediately north of a very small embayment located 1.2 km north of Pole Pass, in southern Deer Harbor (Shaw Island quadrangle).  Net shore-drift is to the northwest to the head of Deer Harbor.  The sediment source for this cell is the eroding glacial till found at the shore along most of this drift cell.  The low-tide beach is approximately 20-m-wide near the origin of the cell and increases to a maximum of 80 m near the head of Deer Harbor (Friday Harbor quadrangle), indicating northwestward net shore-drift.  Beach sediment size decreases to the northwest, grading from a mixture of pebbles, cobbles and sand, to predominantly sand near the cell's terminus, with mud accumulating in shallow water, further indicating northwestward net shore-drift.  Nearshore bars trending to the northwest are located south of the town of Deer Harbor and a stream at the head of the harbor shows westward offset to a position near the adjacent uplands, also indicationg northwestward net shore-drift.
