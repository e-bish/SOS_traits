Friday Harbor, Waldron Island, Eastsound quads

No appreciable net shore-drift occurs from Steep Point through Spring Passage and up to the north along the western side of the island for 11 km (Waldron Island and Eastsound quadrangles).  Several pocket beaches and isolated beaches defended by rock prominences are present along this stretch of coast, but no continuous shore drift occurs.
