Eastsound quad

This cell is located along President Channel, opposite Waldron Island. The origin of the cell is located 1.3 km southwest of the private campground at West Beach, in an area that experiences rock slides into the water.  Net shore-drift is northeastward for 1.5 km, depositing at the southern side of the base of an unnamed headland.  Drift sediment is derived from eroding deposits of glacial till that overly Paleozoic-aged rock at the cell's origin.  Abundant sediment is supplied to this drift cell from the valley that West Beach is located in, as glacial till is abundant there.  Beach width increases rapidly to the northeast in this cell, from 10 m at the southern end of the cell to a 70-m-wide low-tide beach at West Beach.  Sediment size fines from boulders and cobbles to pebbles and sand to the northeast, also indicating northeastward net shore-drift.  The nearshore zone is shoaling in the vicinity of West Beach, as fine sand and mud is deposited there.  Nearshore bars are oriented northwest-southeast along this beach, moving northeastward, further indicating northeastward net shore-drift.
