Mt. Constitution quad

This drift cell originates 0.7 km southeast of Raccoon Point, which is northeast of Mt. Constitution.  This cell is approximately 4.2 km in length.  Net shore-drift is northwestward across the northeastern coast of the island until the cell's terminus in a broad depositional zone at the village of Buckhorn.  The maximum fetch for this coastal sector, approximately 22 km, is from the northeast.  The northeast coast of Orcas Island is very steeply sloped, from a 790-m-elevation atop Mt. Constitution down to the shore and into Rosario Straight to 70 m depths.  There is a rocky coast along this drift cell, consisting of Paleozoic-aged marine sedimentary rocks that are fairly resistent to erosion, and a number of broad, slightly concave beaches.  Drift material passes around rocky prominences on a wave cut-platform.  The sediment source for this cell is in the slowly eroding seacliffs east of Raccoon Point.  Sediment is found in larger amounts on the southeast side of rock outcrops for the length of this drift cell and sediment size decreases to the northwest locally, indicating westward net shore-drift.  The terminus of this cell is located at the beach fronting Buckhorn and the east side of Point Thompson.  This sector of shore has a more east-facing orientation than the rest of northern Orcas Island, causing deposition of the small amount of northwestward-moving drift sediment here.  Easterly wind waves, generated from the Georgia Strait and Rosario Strait, are responsible for the net shore-drift in this cell. These waves also transport sediment to the deeper water north of Point Thompson, where it is lost from the littoral system in the absence of a wave-cut platform.  Storm waves from the northwest are largely dissipated by Parker Reef (Eastsound quadrangle) and the shoals in the area north of Terrill Beach before reaching this drift cell.
