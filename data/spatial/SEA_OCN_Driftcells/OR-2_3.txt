Mt. Constitution quad

No appreciable net shore-drift occurs from east of Raccoon Point southeastward to Lawrence Point, a rocky promontory (Lummi Island quadrangle).  There are only discontinuous and isolated beaches along this coast.  From Lawrence Point southwest to Deer Point the coast is rocky with isolated beaches (Mount Constitution and Blakely Island quadrangle).  The villages of Doe Bay and Sea Acres are within this sector.  A number of pocket beaches are present within embayments and shallow indentations in the coast.  These all seem to be isolated systems showing no appreciable net shore-drift.
