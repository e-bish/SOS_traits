The Orcas Island coast along Obstruction Pass is comprised of a 0.5 km stretch of coast west of Deer Point containing a pocket beach and rocky coast with no appreciable net shore-drift.  Cell OR-3 originates at the boulder and cobble beach directly east of Brown Rock and exhibits westward net shore-drift for 0.7 km in northernmost Obstruction Pass, to an accretionary beach.  Sediment size fines to sand and beach width increases dramatically along this sector, evidencing westward net shore-drift.  Sediment has accumulated on the east side of a large rock outcrop in the center of this cell, also indicating westward net-shore drift.
