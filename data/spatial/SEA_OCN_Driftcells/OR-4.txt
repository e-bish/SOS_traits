This net shore-drift cell originates near the western end of Obstruction Pass, on the eastern side of several rocky headlands.  Net shore-drift is northeastward along a concave beach for 0.7 km to a zone of drift convergence.  Beach width increases and mean sediment size decreases to the northeast, indicating net shore-drift in that direction, to the center of an accretionary beach.
