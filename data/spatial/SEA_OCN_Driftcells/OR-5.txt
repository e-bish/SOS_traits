Blakely quad

This 2.2-km-long cell originates immediately north of the unnamed point south of the town of Olga.  Net shore-drift is northward into the mouth of Buck Bay, where sediment is deposited along the eastern shore of the bay.  Beach width increases and the mean sediment size generally decreases to the north in this cell, indicating northward net shore-drift.  A large accumulation of sediment is located several hundred meters south of the mouth of Buck Bay against the southern side of a rocky headland, and also southwest of a rock groin crossing the beach just inside the mouth of the bay, further indicating northward net shore-drift.  Sediment is also entering the bay from a stream discharging at the head of Buck Bay.  Northward net shore-drift in this cell is driven by waves from the open fetch toward Lopez Sound to the south.
