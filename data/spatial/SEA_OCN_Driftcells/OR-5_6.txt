Blakely Island, Mount Constitution quads

The coast west of Buck Bay becomes more linear 2 km west and north of the town of Olga.  This sector contains three small indentations in the coast that are separated by rocky prominences.  There is a very limited sediment supply in this area and no means of continuous transport around the rocky prominence, resulting in no appreciable net shore-drift.
