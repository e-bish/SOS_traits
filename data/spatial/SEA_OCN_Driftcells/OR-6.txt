Mt. Constitution quad

This 2.3-km-long cell originates along the eastern shore of East Sound, 2.0 km south of Rosario Point.  Net shore-drift is northward, depositing sediment in a broad zone in the northern 1 km of the drift cell, which has its terminus at the head of Cascade Bay.  The sediment source for this cell is the erosional rocky coast of this area, in combination with stream sediment input.  Beach width increases locally (between rock prominence) to the north as sediment accumulates against the southern sides of rock outcrops.  Local decreases in sediment grain size to the north occur in each section of shore demarcated by rock outcrops.  Sand is the predominant sediment in the 1-km-long, wide beach extending to the Rosario Resort marina.
