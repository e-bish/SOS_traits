Mt. Constitution, Eastsound quads

No appreciable net shore-drift occurs from Rosario Resort around Rosario Point and northward until 0.5 km beyond the Coon Hollow embayment (Eastsound quadrangle).  There are only discontinuous and isolated pocket beaches along this coast, originating primarily from sediment input from small streams.
