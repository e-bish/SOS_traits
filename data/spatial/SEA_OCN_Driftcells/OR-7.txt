Eastsound quad

This cell is a 2.3-km-long net shore-drift cell originating 0.5 km north of Coon Hollow that exhibits northwestward net shore-drift into Ship Bay, located at the head of East Sound.  Net shore-drift is limited to a very small volume of sediment within the first 0.5 km of the cell, along a narrow cobble and boulder beach.  As the shore of East Sound curves to the northwest, beach width increases rapidly and grades into finer gravel, indicating northwestward net shore-drift.  As the coast bends to the northwest, a large amount of sediment is introduced into the littoral system from eroding bluffs composed of glacial till.  A tide flat approximately 80-m-wide is present in front of Crescent Beach, probably the largest accumulation of sediment found along the shore of Orcas Island, due to the large exposures of glacial till.  Nearshore bars trend to the northwest, further indicating net shore-drift in that direction.  Beach width increases across Crescent Beach with the widest section located at the western end, the terminus of the cell.  This is also the only location where a predominantly sandy high-tide beach is found within this sector, further indicating that the terminus of this net shore-drift cell is located against the base of Madrona Point.   Madrona Point is a rocky headland that is resistent to erosion and does not contribute any appreciable amount of sediment to the shore drift system from either its eastern or western side.
