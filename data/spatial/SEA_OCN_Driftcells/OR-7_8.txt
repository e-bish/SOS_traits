Eastsound quad

Madrona Point is a rocky headland that is resistant to erosion and does not contribute any appreciable amount of sediment to the shore drift system from either its eastern or western side.  

No appreciable net shore-drift occurs at Madrona Point or in Fishing Bay, where there is a pocket beach located in front of the town of Eastsound.  A stream supplies sediment to this pocket beach.  Directly in front of this beach is a small, unnamed island that has a spit extending from its northern side towards the north, indicating that northward net shore-drift is occurring on the island.  A second pocket beach is located in the northwest corner of Fishing Bay, then a short stretch of rocky coast with no appreciable net shore-drift is found.
