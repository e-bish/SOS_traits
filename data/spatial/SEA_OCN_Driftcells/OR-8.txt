Eastsound quad

This is a cell of approximately 300 m in length with a small amount of sediment moving along the northern shore of Judd Bay to the cell's terminus at the head of the bay.  Westward net shore-drift is evidenced by the progression from a boulder and cobble beach in front of the headland at the northern entrance to Judd Bay, to a predominantly sandy beach, that is fronted by a tide flat, at the head of the bay.  A westward increase in beach width also indicates net shore-drift to the west, into the bay.
