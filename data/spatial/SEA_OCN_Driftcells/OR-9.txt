Eastsound quad

This 1.5-km-long cell originates approximately 1 km south of Judd Bay along the rocky seacliffs of the western shore of East Sound.  Net shore-drift is northward and into the head of Judd Bay, combining with the sediment deposited by the adjacent cell to the north.  The coastline is irregular within this cell, causing the beach to become very narrow in front of rock prominences.  Local net shore-drift indicators are present within each of these sectors: large accumulations of sediment occur on the south side of these obstacles partially interrupting drift, beach width increases and sediment size decreases to the north.  Net shore-drift continues around the point adjacent to Judd Bay and exhibits the same indicators along the southern side of the bay.  

There is a 1.0 km sector south of this cell where no appreciable net shore-drift occurs, as this is a rocky coast with very minimal amounts of sediment.
