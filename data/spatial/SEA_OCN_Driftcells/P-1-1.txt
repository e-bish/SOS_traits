Cape Disappointment quad

This drift cell begins at a zone of divergence located approximately one kilometer south of North Head and continues to a terminus area at the North Jetty of the Columbia River. Clockwise rotation of the eddy current of the Columbia River flowing around the North Jetty causes sediments to impinge on the shore at the zone of divergence and spread to the north and south.  The direction of net shore-drift for this cell is to the south as indicated by fining of sediments in this direction and a gradual rise in elevation and widening of the beach north of the jetty. 

Note: The Southwest Washington Coastal Erosion Study is gathering information on the evolution, processes, geology, and hazards of the Columbia River littoral cell.  The study area extends approximately 160 km along the Pacific Northwest coast between Tillamook Head, Oregon and Point Grenville, Washington.
