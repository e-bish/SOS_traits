Cape Disappointment quad

Beginning at a zone of divergence approximately one kilometer south of North Head this drift cell develops to the north and terminates at the barrier imposed by the igneous rocks forming North Head.  This drift cell is the result of an eddy current from the Columbia River which rotates clockwise around the North Jetty and impinges on the shore at a zone of divergence spreading sediments to the north and south. Northern movement within this cell is indicated by fining of sediments in this direction and by a gradual rise in the beach elevation to the north. 

Note: The Southwest Washington Coastal Erosion Study is gathering information on the evolution, processes, geology, and hazards of the Columbia River littoral cell.  The study area extends approximately 160 km along the Pacific Northwest coast between Tillamook Head, Oregon and Point Grenville, Washington.
