Beginning in a zone between North Head and Beards Hollow this 40 kilometer drift cell develops along the shore to the north.  Drift in this direction is indicated by Columbia River sediments prograding along the coast forming an extensive dune system, and beach sediments becoming finer to the north.  Further evidence for the transport of sediments in this direction is the hooked spit at the terminus of this drift cell which has developed to the North, turning east at Leadbetter Point into Willapa Bay. 

Note: The Southwest Washington Coastal Erosion Study is gathering information on the evolution, processes, geology, and hazards of the Columbia River littoral cell.  The study area extends approximately 160 km along the Pacific Northwest coast between Tillamook Head, Oregon and Point Grenville, Washington.
