North Cove quad

This drift cell begins at a zone of divergence in the area of Cape Shoalwater and continues eastward into Willapa Bay.  Waves driven predominantly by southwest winds impinge on the shore at the zone of divergence causing sediment movement to both the north and east.  Drift direction for this cell is indicated by the long-term eastward development of spits and sand bars occurring within the north side of the entrance to Willapa Bay.

Shoreline processes at Cape Shoalwater and the mouth of Willapa Bay are subject to change over time. The current erosion episode at this location probably began between 1965 and 1970. The Southwest Washington Coastal Erosion Study is gathering information on the evolution, processes, geology, and hazards of the Columbia River littoral cell.  The study area extends approximately 160 km along the Pacific Northwest coast between Tillamook Head, Oregon and Point Grenville, Washington.
