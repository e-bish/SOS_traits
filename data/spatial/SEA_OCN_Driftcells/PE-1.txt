Roche Harbor quad

This cell is the only drift cell on Pearl Island, and is located on the northern shore.  Net shore-drift is to the west, originating immediately west of the rocky eastern end of the island.  Westward net shore-drift is evidenced by increased beach width and decreased sediment size in that direction.  Net shore-drift terminates along the beach south of Posey Island, where the wave shadow of Posey Island extends to Pearl Island.  A very wide beach is present here, located opposite a small spit on Posey Island.
