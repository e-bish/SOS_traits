Tacoma North quad

Originating at a drift divergence at the headland south-west of Dumas
Bay, this drift cell with south to southwesterly shore drift crosses
the King-Pierce County line and reaches a terminus at Dash Point (Pierce County).  
The portion of the drift cell in King County has a broad intertidal terrace 
and the most striking indicator of net shore-drift is a series of oblique bars 
across this terrace oriented perpendicular to the northeasterly predominant-wave 
approach.  These oblique bars (best observed on air photos) are the most 
extensive series of this type of feature observed in King County. Most of this
coastal stretch is unmodified park land, but a limited number of groins
or bulkhead offsets show sediment accumulation on the northwest side.
The stream at Dash Point State Park is riprapped to preclude any
present-day offset, but the backshore is 2-3 m wider on the north
side.  Additional indicators include an accumulation of sediment on 
the east side of bulkhead offsets, and increasing beach slope to the west.  
This drift cell terminates in Pierce County at Dash Point, a cuspate spit.
