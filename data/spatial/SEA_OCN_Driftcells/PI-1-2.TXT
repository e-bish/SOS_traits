Originating at a zone of divergence approximately 0.6 km south of Dash
Point, this drift cell exhibits northerly net shore-drift and
termi-nates at Dash Point, a cuspate spit.  Geomorphic indicators are a
northerly decrease in sediment size, increase in beach slope, and
sediment accumulation on the south side of bulkhead offsets.
