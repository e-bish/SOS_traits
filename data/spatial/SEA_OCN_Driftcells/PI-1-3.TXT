Browns Point, the second cuspate spit located along northeast Tacoma,
is the terminus of this drift cell.  Originating at a zone of
diver-gence approximately 0.6 km south of Dash Point, this drift cell
shows a marked increase of beach width and slope in a westerly
direc-tion.  An ideal drift indicator is located just west of the north
end of Wan-i-da Road.  At that point there is a concrete boat ramp with
an accumu-lation of sediment on the east side, vertically offset 0.67
m.  The tip of Browns Point has a wide, steep mid- and upper foreshore
of large pebbles with a relatively narrow coarse sand lower foreshore.
High wave energy along this coastline effective-ly removes the finer
sediment from the foreshore into a sediment sink 160 m deep not far off
Browns Point.
