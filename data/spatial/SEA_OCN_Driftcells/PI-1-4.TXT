This drift cell begins with a zone of divergence approxi-mately 1.25 km
southeast of Browns Point (almost directly beneath the Cliff House
Restaurant) and has its terminus at a cuspate spit located at Browns
Point. The 10-15 m vertical till cliff at the zone of divergence has a
foreshore of cobble- and boulder-size sediment that gradually decreases
in size to small cobbles and pebbles along a coastal stretch of
approximately 0.7 km.  At that point another 5-7 m eroding till cliff
contributes more sediment to the foreshore, again decreasing in size
northerly to the terminus area of pebble-size sediment.  This evidence,
along with a large accumulation on the south sides of bulkhead offsets
demonstrates the northwesterly direction of net shore-drift.
