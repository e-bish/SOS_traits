A zone of divergence located at the mid-point of Section 21 (1.25 km
south of Browns Point) is the beginning of this drift cell.  An
easterly, then southeasterly, direction of net shore-drift is indicated
by a decrease in mean sediment size to the east, sediment accumulation
on the northwest sides of drift obstructions, and an increase in the
width of the backshore to the east.  Located approximately 300 m east
of the zone of divergence is a very large (20 m x 50 m) barge that has
been grounded on the upper foreshore.  On its northwest side is a large
accumula-tion of sediment and debris that can be clearly seen from a
distance and on air photographs.  The terminus of this drift cell is
within the Tyee Marina facility.  Hundreds of moored boats, log booms,
floating docks, and numerous permanently anchored ships effectively
dampen the wave action that is needed for sediment transport.

South of the Tyee Marina there is a coastal stretch that is cut off
from continuous, regular wave action by multiple log booms and numerous
sections of rafted logs that are semi-permanent.  No appreciable net
shore-drift occurs along this coastal stretch.
