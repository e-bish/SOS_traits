Fox Island

This drift cell originates at a zone of divergence along an embayment
just northwest of the cove at Hope (Cedrona Cove).  A northwesterly net
shore-drift is indicated by a decreasing mean sediment size, increasing 
beach slope, sediment accumulated on the southeast sides
of metal culverts, a tire groin, multiple low wood groins
approximately 1 km north of Hope, and at numerous bulkhead offsets,
with erosion also occurring at the northwest ends. The drift cell 
terminates at a recurved spit prograding westerly from a 
small promontory just north of the cable-crossing area.
