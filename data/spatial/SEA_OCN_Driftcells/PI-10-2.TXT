A zone of divergence along an embayment northwest of Hope is the
beginning of this drift cell.  Net shore-drift is to the southeast,
terminating in a cove adjacent to Hope (Cedrona Cove).  Indicators of
drift in a southeasterly direction are a mean decrease in sediment
size, an increase in beach slope, and sediment accumulated on the north
side of drift obstruc-tions.
