The zone of divergence at Gibson Point is the beginning of this drift
cell.  A northerly net shore-drift is demonstrated by a northerly
decrease in bluff slope, an increase in beach width and slope, sediment
accumu-lation on the south side of numerous boat ramps, and erosion on
the north ends of bulkhead offsets.  A northwesterly prograding spit,
building across a small embayment northeast of Hope, and a northerly
prograding recurved spit at Cedrona Cove (Hope), are additional
indicators of northerly net shore drift.  The drift cell terminates
at a recurved spit at Cedrona Cove (Hope).
