This drift cell originates in a zone of diver-gence at Gibson Point and
ends along a wide sand shelf and concave coast-line 3.5 km northwest of
Gibson Point.  Boulders and cobbles at Gibson Point grade into small
cobbles and pebbles along the upper foreshore at the terminus.
Numerous trees have fallen across the foreshore, with each having an
accumulation of sediment on the southeast side.  Several groins and
boat ramps have substantial sediment accumulations on the southeast
sides where the few residences are located along the shoreline.
