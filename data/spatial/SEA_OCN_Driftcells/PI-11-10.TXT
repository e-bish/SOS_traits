Tanglewood Island

A zone of divergence located along the north-northeast end of
Tanglewood Island is the origin of a drift cell displaying a southerly
net shore-drift, with a terminus at the south end of the island.
Southerly net shore-drift indicators include a mean decrease in
sediment size, and a slight decrease in bluff slope and increase in
bluff stability.
