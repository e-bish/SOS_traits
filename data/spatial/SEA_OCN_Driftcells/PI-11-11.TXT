Tanglewood Island

This drift cell begins along a zone of diver-gence at the
north-northeast end of Tanglewood Island, and ends at the south end of
the island, via the west side.  A southerly net shore-drift is
indicated by a small intertidal spit near the northwest end of the
island, and a southerly decrease in sediment size and bluff slope.
Southwest of Tanglewood Island, on Fox Island, there is a linear
stretch of coastline where the sediment is shifted laterally along the
foreshore depend-ing on the direction of the waves refracted around the
numerous head-lands and barriers.  There is no appreciable net
shore-drift evident in this area.
