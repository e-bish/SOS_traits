The origin of this drift cell is a zone of divergence located along
Shorewood Beach.  This area is also the location of a potential erosion
hazard where two private residences are constructed perilously close to
the edge of an eroding till bluff.  From Shorewood Beach toward a
terminus to the south, a small embayment (Echo Bay), a southerly
direction of net shore-drift is exhibited.  Indicators as evidence for
southerly drift include a boat launch with sediment accumulated on its
north side, a mean sediment size decrease, and bluff slope decrease
within Echo Bay.
