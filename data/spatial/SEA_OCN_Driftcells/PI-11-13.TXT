Beginning at a zone of divergence along Shore-wood Beach, this drift
cell exhibits southerly net shore-drift, and terminates in a cove
between Shorewood Beach and the Fox Island Bridge.  The southerly drift
direction is demonstrated by minor accumulations of sediment on the
north side of drift obstructions, erosion at the south end of a
bulk-head offset, and a decrease in mean sediment size toward the
cove.
