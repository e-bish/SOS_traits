This drift cell begins at a till wave-cut platform adjacent to the east
side of the Fox Island Bridge abutment.  A southerly net shore-drift is
indicated y a southerly increase in beach slope, sediment accumula-tion
on the north sides of drift obstructions, and erosion on the south ends
of a few bulkhead offsets.  This cell terminates in a cove between the
Fox Island Bridge and Shorewood Beach.
