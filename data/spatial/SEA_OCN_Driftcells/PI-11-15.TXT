The origin of this drift cell is a till wave-cut platform adjacent to
the west side of the Fox Island Bridge abutment.  The net shore-drift
along this short coastal stretch is to the south, terminating in a
sandy cove between the Fox Island Bridge and a small promontory west of
the bridge.  The primary indicators of this drift direction are an
accumulation of sediment on the north side of a public boat ramp and
the rock retaining walls around the launching area, and erosion on the
south side of the boat ramp and launching area.
