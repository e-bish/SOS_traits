Fox Island

This drift cell begins in a zone of divergence approximately 200 m east
of Nearns Point.  An easterly net shore-drift is indicated by a
decrease in sediment size, an increase in beach width, and sediment
accumu-lated on the west side of bulkhead offsets and other drift
obstruc-tions; particularly a boat ramp just west of the small
promontory adjacent to the Fox Island Bridge.  The drift cell
terminates in an embayment between the Fox Island Bridge and a small
promontory to the west.
