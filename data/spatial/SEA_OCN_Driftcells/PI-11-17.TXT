Fox Island

This short drift cell originates in a zone of divergence approximately
200 m east of Nearns Point, exhibits a westerly net shore-drift, and
terminates on the east side of the Nearns Point spit.  Westerly drift
direction indicators include small accumulations of sediment ont eh
east side od drift obstructions, a slight westerly offset of a drainage
channel from a metal culvert, and a small increase in beach slope.
This area is located i a low wave-energy regime, with much of the
transport energy coming from waves refracted around the tip of Nearns
Point.
