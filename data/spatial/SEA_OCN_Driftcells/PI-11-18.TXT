Fox Island

A northerly net shore-drift is exhibited by this drift cell,
originating approximate-ly 1 km south of Nearns Point and ending at
Nearns Point, a recurved spit.  A unique drift indicator is found along
this coastal stretch, consisting of pieces of red brick strewn down
drift (north) from an origin at a  deteriorating wall 800 m from the
terminus.  Pieces of this brick are traceable to within 100 m of the
Nearns Point spit.  Additional northerly drift indicators include a
decrease in mean sediment size, and increase in upper foreshore width
and slope, and sediment accumulated on the south sides of fallen trees,
bulkhead offsets, and other drift obstructions.
