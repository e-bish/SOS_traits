Fox Island

This segment includes the zone of divergence and northern part of a
drift cell originating at the northwest end of Fox Island and
terminating 2 km southeast of the Carr Inlet Naval Acoustic Testing
Center (shown on the map as a dock south of a spring).
The southerly net shore-drift is indicated by an accumulation of
sediment and debris on the northeast side of bulkhead offsets and boat
ramps and an increas-ing beach width and beach slope. There is a large
accreting lens of sediment on the northwest side of the Acoustic Center, 
which is built out a short distance from the bluff and protected by riprap.
There appears to be a pair of beach ridges built across a small coastal 
indentation, from the northwest to the southeast, approximately 1 km 
southeast of the Carr Inlet Naval Acoustic Testing 
Center.
