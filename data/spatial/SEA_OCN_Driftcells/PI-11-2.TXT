Fox Island

This extremely short drift cell is caused by wave refraction around
the end of a westerly prograding spit, at the tip of an adjacent
promontory (Section 36).  The origin of this drift cell is 30 meters
west of the spit, and terminates on the lagoon side of that spit.  The
southeasterly shore-drift is exhibited by an increase in beach slope,
and sediment accumu-lation on the west side of a boat ramp near the
terminus.
