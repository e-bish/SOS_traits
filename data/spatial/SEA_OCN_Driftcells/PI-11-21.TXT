The origin of this drift cell is a coastal stretch, recently modified
by a seawall, to the west of East Cromwe-ll.  The position of this
sea-wall allows only a small amount of sediment to be transported from
this area, contributing to the subtle drift indicators evident in this
drift cell.  Northerly net shore-drift is indicated by a decrease in
mean sediment size, sediment accumulated on the south side of boat
ramps, bulkhead offsets, and other drift obstructions, and the slight
northerly offset of a stream channel north of the Tacoma Yacht Club
pier (Section 19).  The terminus of this drift cell is at the mudflat
at the north end of Wollochet Bay.
