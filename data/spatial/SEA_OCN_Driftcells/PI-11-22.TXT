This drift cell begins in a zone of divergence west of East Cromwell.
The zone of divergence has been modified by the recent emplacement of a
large seawall along this coastal stretch.  A northwesterly net
shore-drift is exhibited by sediment fining and beach width increasing
to the west, a west-ward stream channel offset at Sunny Bay, and
sediment accumulated on the east side of numerous boat ramps.  The
terminus of this drift cell is the east side of the Fox Island Bridge
abutment.
