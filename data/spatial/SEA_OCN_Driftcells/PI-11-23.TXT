A zone of divergence located at the end of Ray Nash Drive (south of
Arletta) is the origin of this drift cell.  An easterly net
shore--drift along this coastal stretch terminates on the west side of
the Fox Island Bridge abutment.  The eastward drift direction is
demonstrated by an eastward prograding spit offsetting a stream
channel, sediment size decrease and beach slope increase to the east,
and numerous bulkhead offsets and other drift obstructions with
sediment accumulated on the west side.
