The zone of divergence of this drift cell is located at the south end
of Ray Nash Drive (south of Arletta).  A short distance of westward net
shore-drift is indicated by an immediate decrease in mean sediment size
and increase in beach width.  The terminus of this drift cell, directly
north of Shaws Cove, is characterized by a broad, gently sloping sand
shelf, a wide backshore, and a large accumulation of debris at the berm
crest.
