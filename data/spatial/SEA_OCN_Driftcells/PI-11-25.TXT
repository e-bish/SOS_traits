A 5 m till bluff, 300 m north of Shaws Cove, is the zone of divergence
for this drift cell.  A northerly net shore-drift is indicated by
sediment accumulation ont eh south side of a bulkhead offset, a
northward decrease in mean sediment size and increase in beach width.
A broad, gently sloping sand shelf with a large accumulation of debris
and wide backshore is the terminus of this drift cell.
