Originating at a zone of divergence 300 m north of Shaws Cove, this
drift cell exhibits southward net shore-drift, and terminates in Shaws
Cove.  The drift direction is demon-strated by a southerly decrease in
mean sediment size, and sediment accumulated on the north side of boat
ramps and a series of groins near the south end of Shaws Cove.
