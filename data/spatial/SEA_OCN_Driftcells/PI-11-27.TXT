A northeasterly net shore-drift is exhibited in this drift cell,
originating along a zone of divergence at Green Point, and terminating
at a northward prograding spit forming Shaws Cove.  Evidence for drift
in a northward direction include a boat ramp to the immediate east of
the divergence, with sediment accumulated on the west side and erosion
on the east side, a rapid northeasterly decrease in sediment size and
increase in beach width and beach slope.
