This drift cell originates in a zone of divergence at green Point.  The
northerly net shore-drift is demonstrated by sediment accumulation on
the south sides of boat ramps and bulkhead offsets, northerly sediment
size decrease,, beach width and beach slope increase, and bluff slope
de-crease.  The terminus of this drift cell is a northward prograding
spit at the tip of Forest Beach.  The south and southwest sides of the
Horsehead Peninsu-la, influenced by the predominate southwest winds,
generally have a thin veneer of sediment covering a wave-cut platform
extending nearly 1 km along the shore.  There is no berm or backshore
developed along this coastal stretch; subsequently, the bluffs are
subjected to wave attack and fairly rapid erosion.
