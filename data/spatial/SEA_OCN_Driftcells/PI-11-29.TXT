Horsehead Bay has a heavily modified, low wave energy coastal sector.
Erosion occurring along areas of unprotected shore is mostly the result
of tidal action and mass wasting.  Net shore-drift, originating just
south of the Forest Beach spit, proceeds southward, and terminates in a
mudflat at the south end of Horsehead Bay.  Indicators of southerly net
shore--drift include sediment accumu-lated on the north sides of drift
obstacles, slight drainage channel offsets to the south, and minor
erosion on the south side of bulkhead offsets and boat ramps.
