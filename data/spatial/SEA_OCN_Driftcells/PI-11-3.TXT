Fox Island

Originating in a zone of divergence approximately 150 m east of Ketners
Point, this drift cell exhibits a westerly net shore-drift termi-nating
in a small embayment adjacent to Ketners Point.  The westerly drift is
the result of wave refraction around a spit prograding westerly from an
adjacent promontory, and is demonstrated by a decrease in mean
sedi-ment size, erosion at the west end of a bulkhead, minor westerly
stream channel offsets, and sediment accumulated on the east sides of
drift obstructions.
