The zone of divergence for this drift cell is located 400 m north of
Camp Colman.  A southerly net shore-drift is indicated by sediment and
debris accumulated on the north side of numerous boat ramps with
erosion taking place on the south sides.  A southerly decrease in
sediment size, and a lowering of bluff slope, from a high cliff north
of Camp Colman to a gentle slope at the end of the bay, are additional
indica-tors of a southerly net shore-drift.
