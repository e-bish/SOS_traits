This drift cell includes a zone of divergence 400 m north of Camp Colman,
and exhibits a northerly net shore-drift.  Proceeding north from the 
divergence zone there is a decrease in mean sediment size from an origin 
of boulders and cobbles, to small cobbles and pebbles along the foreshore 
at Kopachuck State Park.  Along the stretch of coastline fronting 
Kopachuck State Park are lobes of gravel at an oblique angle to the 
shoreline.  They generally have gently sloping sides on the up-drift 
side, steeper sloping sides on the downdrift side, and hooked seaward 
ends pointing in the downdrift direction.  This suggests the occurrence 
of northerly migrating cusp-type gravel bars along this coastal stretch.  
Other drift indicators include sediment accumulation on the south sides of
drift obstructions, and a widening upper foreshore to the north.

A northeasterly direction of net shore-drift is also indicated by sediment 
accumulating on the southwest side of groins, a northerly prograd-ng spit 
offsetting lagoon drainage to the north, erosion at the north ends of bulk-
heads, and a northerly decrease in mean sediment size.  This drift cell
terminates at a prograding sand spit beneath the mainland end of the 
Raft Island Bridge.
