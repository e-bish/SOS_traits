Fox Island

The origin of this drift cell is a zone of divergence nearly the entire
length of the east side of Ketners Point, as demonstrated by the linear
trend of the shoreline, and the north-south extent of a wave-cut
plat-form.  This drift cell exhibits a southerly net shore-drift
indicated by a decrease in sediment size, and sediment accumulated on
the north side of a boat ramp and other drift obstructions.  The drift
cell terminates in a sandy embayment southeast of Ketners Point.
