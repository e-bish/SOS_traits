Fox Island

Beginning at a zone of divergence encompassing almost the entire east
side of Ketners Point, this drift cell exhibits northerly net
shore-drift, and terminates at Ketners Point.  Indicators of a
northerly drift direction include a northerly prograding intertidal
spit, sediment size decrease and beach slope increase to the north, and
sediment accumulated on the south side of a boat ramp.
