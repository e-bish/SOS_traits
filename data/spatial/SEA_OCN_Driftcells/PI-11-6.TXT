Fox Island

This short drift cell originates at a zone of divergence 50-75 m south
of Ketners Point.  The northerly drift direction is demonstrated by an
immediate northerly decrease in sediment size, and a concrete bulkhead
having sediment accumulat-ed on the south side and erosion occurring on
the north side.  The wave energy of this cell is just sufficient to
keep sediment from passing around Ketners Point from east to west,
although some may pass during storm conditions (see Drift Cell 11-5).
