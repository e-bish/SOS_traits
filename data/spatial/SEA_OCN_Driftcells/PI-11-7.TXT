Fox Island

Emerging from a zone of divergence 100 m south of Ketners Point, this
drift cell exhibits southerly net shore-drift, and terminates in a cove
between Ketners Point and a small glacial headland to the west (Edgar
Point).  Evidence for a southerly drift direction includes a decrease
in mean sediment size, minor erosion on the south ends of bulkhead
offsets, and an accumulation of sediment on the north side of a boat
launch near the terminus.
