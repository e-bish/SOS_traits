Fox Island

This short drift cell originates in a zone of divergence at the dip of
a glacial headland adjacent to Ketners Point, called Edgar Point.  The
southerly net shore-drift is indicated by an accumula-tion of sedi-ment
on the north side of a small rock groin, and a southerly decrease in
mean sediment size.  The terminus of this drift cell is the cove
between Edgar Point and Ketners Point.
