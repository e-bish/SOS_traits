Fox Island

Beginning in a zone of divergence at the tip of a glacial headland
(Edgar Point) west of Ketners Point, this drift cell exhibits southerly
net shore-drift, and terminates at a cove southwest of Edgar Point.
The southerly drift direction is demonstrated by a southerly decrease
in bluff slope and sediment size, and sediment accumulation on the
north sides of bulkhead offsets.
