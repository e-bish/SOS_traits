This short cell originates at a zone of diver-gence on the southwest
end of Cutts Island.  Northward net shore-drift moves sedi-ment around
the west side of the island, terminating in a long spit prograding
northerly from the island's north side.  A northerly net shore-drift is
indi-cated by a decrease in sediment size and bluff slope, and an
increase in beach slope.
