Originating in a zone of divergence on a point at the east entrance to
Lay Inlet, this drift cell exhibits northward net shore-drift, and
terminates at the north end of Lay Inlet.  Indicators of drift
direction include a northward decrease in sediment size, and sediment
accumu-lation on the south side of drift obstructions.
