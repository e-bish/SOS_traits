This drift cell originates on the west side of Lay Inlet, approximately
30 m north of the inlet entrance.  A northerly net shore-drift is
indicated by sediment accumulated on the south side of drift
obstructions, erosion at the north end of a bulkhead 100 m into the
inlet, and a slight northerly decrease in mean sediment size.
