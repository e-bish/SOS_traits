Raft Island

This drift cell begins at a zone of divergence along the southwest
shore of Raft Island.  An easterly net shore-drift is indicated by
sediment accumulated on the west side of boat ramps and other drift
obstruc-tions, an eastward decrease in mean sediment size and bluff
slope, and an increase in beach slope and width.  The terminus of this
drift cell is an eastwardly prograding spit, east of the Raft Island
Bridge.
