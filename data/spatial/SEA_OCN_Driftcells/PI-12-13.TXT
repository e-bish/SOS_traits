Raft Island

This short drift cell begins at a collapsing wooden bulkhead 200 m east
of the Raft Island Bridge and exhibits an easter-ly net shore-drift.
Moving east from the promontory at which it originates, the sediment
fines and becomes lodged on the west side of drift obstructions.  The
terminus of this cell is a small intertidal cuspate spit made up of
sand, silt, and small pieces of clay.

The shoreline along Raft Island for 75 m east of the spit in
is in the wind shadow of the spit, the bridge pilings,
and a floating dock extending east from the spit.  No appreciable net
shore-drift occurs in this area.
