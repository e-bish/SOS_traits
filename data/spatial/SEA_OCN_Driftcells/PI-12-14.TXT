Raft Island

Beginning at a zone of divergence along the southwest shoreline of Raft
Island, the net shore-drift moves in a clockwise direction around the
north side of the island until it reaches a small silty-sand and clay
intertidal cuspate spit.  The drift material moves clockwise around the
island in response to the various directions of predominant waves
approaching the arcuate shoreline.  Indicators for the direction of
shore-drift include an accumulation of sediment on the southwest side
of a boat ramp 300 m north of the origin; and a decrease in mean
sediment size from boulders and cobbles on the southwest foreshore, to
cobbles and pebbles on the north foreshore, to silty-sand, mud, and
clay on the east side.  Additional indicators include erosion at the
east end of bulkheads on the north side of the island, and accumulation
of sediment on the updrift side of fallen trees, where they occur.  An
erosion hazard exists on the southwest side of the island where a 
home, built close to the edge of a rapidly eroding bluff, is at the center
of the zone of divergence for drift cells PI-12-12 and PI-12-14.
