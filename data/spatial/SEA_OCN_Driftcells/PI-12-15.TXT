From a zone of divergence located along a glacial headland, south of
Allen Point, net shore-drift moves in a southeasterly direction,
ultimately terminating at a recurved spit at the entrance to Lay Inlet
(Yakima Point).  The southeast drift direction is demonstrated by a
decrease in mean sediment size and bluff slope, sediment accumulation
on the northwest side of boat ramps and bulkhead offsets, and the
easterly prograding recurved spit at Yakima Point.
