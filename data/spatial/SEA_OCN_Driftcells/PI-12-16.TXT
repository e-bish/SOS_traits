This drift cell originates at a zone of divergence south of Allen
Point, along a glacial headland, and exhibits a northwest, then
north-east, direction of net shore-drift  and ends near the Pierce-
Kitsap County line.  Immediately to the northwest of the divergence 
there is a 150 m gravel spit forming on one side of a double tombolo 
connecting the mainland to Allen Point.  The southwest shoreline of 
Allen Point is eroding back providing the sediment for the spit 
connecting the north side of Allen Point to the mainland.  North 
of Allen Point indicators of net shore-drift include sediment 
accumulated on the south side of drift obstructions, an eastward 
prograding gravel spit fronted by an eastward pro-grading
intertid-al sand spit at the cove 1 km north of Allen Point, and a
northerly decrease in mean sediment size.


Evidence for a northward drift direction is demonstrated by a northerly 
beach width increase and bluff slope decrease, a northeasterly prograding
spit south of McCormick Creek, a small gravel lobe encroaching on a
marshy area at the mouth of McCormick Creek, sediment accumulation on
the south sides of bulkhead offsets and boat launches, and a northward
stream channel offset south of the entrance to the Burley Lagoon.
Inside the lagoon, northward net shore-drift indicators include a
commercially-modified spit offsetting Purdy Creek northward, sediment
accumulation on the south side of drift obstructions, and a small
intertidal spit prograding northward from the tip of a promontory
north of Purdy. North of this spit there is no apparent net shore-drift.
