Originating at a zone of divergence on the south end of Cutts Island,
this drift cell exhibits a norther-ly net shore-drift along the east
side of the island, and termi-nates in a prograding spit at the
island's north side. The drift direction is demonstrated by an
immediate decrease in sediment size and bluff slope, and an increase in
beach slope.
