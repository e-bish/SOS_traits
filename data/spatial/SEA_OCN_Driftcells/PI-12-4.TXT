This short drift cell begins in a zone of diver-gence (Section 10) east
of the Raft Island Bridge and terminates east of a small structure
built across the foreshore into Rose-dale Bay.  The extremely low wave
energy along this shoreline results in a westerly net shore-drift
exhibited by erosion of the west end of a bulkhead, and minor sediment
accumulation on the east sides of drift obstructions.
