Originating in a zone of divergence east of the Raft Island Bridge,
this drift cell displays an easterly net shore-drift, and terminates in
a cove 0.6 km east of the Raft Island Bridge.  The drift indicators
present include sand accumulated on the west side of a bulkhead offset
and other drift obstructions, and a prograding sand and silt lobe along
the curved entrance of the cove.
