This drift cell originates opposite the southeast end of Raft Island,
approximately halfway along the west shore-line of an elongate
promon-tory.  Northerly net shore-drift is indicated by a northerly
sediment size decrease, sediment accumu-lated on the south side of a
boat ramp, and a north-northeasterly prograding sand and shell fragment
lobe at the tip of the promon-tory.  The terminus of the drift cell is
just within the opening in the eastern-most cove in Rosedale Bay. The
eastern-most cove in Rosedale Bay shows no appreciable net
shore--drift.  The shoreline is currently undergoing subaerial erosion
and mass wasting.
