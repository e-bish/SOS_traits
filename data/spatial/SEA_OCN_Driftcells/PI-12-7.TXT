This drift cell begins in a localized zone of divergence along a short
linear section of coastline.  The area is located across from the east
end of Raft Island, at the end of a southward projecting promontory.
Sediment moves southeasterly from a zone of slightly undercut bulkheads
and cobbled beach, to a prograding sand wedge at the tip of the
promontory.  South-easterly net shore-drift is indicated by a southward
decrease in mean sediment size, erosion at the south end of the
bulkhead, and the prograding sand lobe at the south tip of the
promontory.
