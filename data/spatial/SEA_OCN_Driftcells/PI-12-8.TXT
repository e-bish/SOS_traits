The origin of this cell is a zone of divergence at the southwest end of
a promontory in Rosedale Bay (see Drift Cell 12-7).  Norther-ly net
shore-drift is indicated by a northward decrease in mean sediment size,
and sediment accumulated on the south side of drift obstructions.  The
terminus of this cell is an embayment near the section line dividing
Sections 2 and 11.
