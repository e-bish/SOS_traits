Beginning in a zone of divergence at a small point on the east side of
the entrance to Lay Inlet, this drift cell displays a southerly net
shore-drift, and terminates in an embayment near the section line
between Sections 2 and 11.  The drift direction is indicated primarily
by sediment acc-umulated on the north side of drift obstructions.
