The origin of this drift cell is a zone of divergence located 200 m
north of the power lines crossing Burley Lagoon.  A northerly net
shore-drift is indicated by sediment accumulation on the south side of
drift obstructions and erosion on the north side, mean sediment size
decrease to the north, several small drainage channels offset
northerly, a northward prograd-ing spit near the large point south of
the county line, and a small north prograding intertidal spit at the
tip of that point.
