Beginning at a zone of divergence 200 m north of the power line
crossing the lagoon, this drift cell exhibits a southerly net
shore-drift, and terminates in the southwest corner of the Burley
Lagoon.  Evidence indi-cating a southerly drift direction include a
southward decrease in both mean sediment size and bluff slope.  The
north side of the Burley spit is heavily modified to accommo-date a
highway roadbed and oyster farm facilities.  There is no appreciable
net shore--drift evident along this coastal stretch.
