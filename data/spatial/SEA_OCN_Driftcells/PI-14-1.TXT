This drift cell begins at a rapidly eroding till bluff.  Northeast net
shore-drift is exhibited along this coastal stretch by a northward
decrease in sediment size, sediment accumulated on the southwest side
of a rock groin, bulkhead offsets, and other drift obstructions,
erosion on the north side of drift obstructions, a northwesterly 
decrease in sediment size and bluff slope.  There is a also a large 
accumulation of sediment on the southwest side of a ship's keel, 
grounded midway between Minter and Wauna and a 1.1 km long spit 
prograding northward across the north end of Henderson Bay.  The 
terminus of the cell is at the north tip of the spit.


The Minter Creek lagoon is characterized by a broad, narrow mudflat
and low, marshy areas near the north end. No apparent net shore-drift 
occurs here.
