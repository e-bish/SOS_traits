A zone of divergence at the east end of Sunshine Beach is the origin of
this drift cell.  Sediment accumulated on the west side of log
obstructions, bulkhead offsets, and boat ramps, a decrease in mean
sediment size and bluff slope, and erosion on the east side of a wooden
bulkhead indicate an eastward net shore-drift.  The terminus of this
cell is in the eastern end of Vaughn Bay.
