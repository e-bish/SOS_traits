A 15 m bluff on the east end of Sunshine Beach is the zone of
divergence in this drift cell.  Northwesterly net shore-drift,
terminating at a recurved spit below Windy Bluff, is indicated by
immediate development and widening of the backshore, increase in beach
slope and decrease in sediment size to the northwest, and the recurved
spit prograding north from the base of Windy Bluff, a glacial
headland.
