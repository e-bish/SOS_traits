Several indicators of northerly net shore-drift are evident along this
drift cell.  Originating on the southeast side of Rocky Bay, the
indicators include a series of groins with sediment accumulated on the
south side, erosion at the north end of a bulkhead on the point of an
eroding, low glacial headland, sediment accumulation on the southwest
side of wooden piles obstructing the drift, and a northeasterly
prograding spit in the east corner of an embayment in the northern part
of Section 34.  The terminus of this cell is the prograding spit at the
east end of the embayment (a stream not shown on the map enters Rocky
Bay here).
