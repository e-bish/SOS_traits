This short drift cell originates in a zone of divergence, a cove in the
north part of Section 34, and exhibits southeast-ward net
shore--drift.  The thinly covered wave-cut platform and undercut
bulkheads at the zone of divergence give way to a southerly increase in
upper foreshore width and slope, and sediment accumulation on the
northwest side of drift obstruc-tions.  The terminus of the cell is a
southward prograding spit into the east corner of the cove.
