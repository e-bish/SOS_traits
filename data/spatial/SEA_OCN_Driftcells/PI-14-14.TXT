From a point of origin in a divergent zone, located in northern Section
34, this drift cell exhibits norther-ly net shore-drift, terminating at
the northern end of Rocky Bay.  Indicators of the drift direc-tion
include erosion at the north end of a bulkhead, a northerly sediment
size decrease, accumulated sediment on the south side of bulkhead
offsets and boat ramps, and a northerly prograded spit offsetting a
small drainage channel northward in Section 1.
