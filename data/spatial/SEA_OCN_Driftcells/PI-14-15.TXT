Northeastward net shore-drift is evident along this section of
coastline.  This drift cell includes the northeast part and terminus of a
drift cell originating at Rocky Point in Mason County.  The drift
direction is indicated by a change in the bluff morphology from the
county line to the northern end of Rocky Bay.  At the beginning of this
segment the beach material is primarily cobbles and pebbles with an
occasional boulder.  This beach material gradually decreases to the
northeast until the northern end of Rocky Bay is predominantly sand,
silt, and mud.  Sediment moving northerly is accumu-lated on the
southwest sides of bulkhead offsets, causing erosion at the north-east
ends.  A large northeastward Prograding spit has impounded a lagoon on
its north side leaving its drainage channel offset to the east.
