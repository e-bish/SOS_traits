This drift cell originates at a zone of diver-gence just east of the
entrance to Glen Cove.  The divergent zone is charac-terized by a 15 m
till bluff fronted by a wide, low-sloped, wave-cut plat-form, and a
foreshore covered with a thin veneer of cobbles and boulders.  North of
this zone the sediment fines to pebbles, granules, and sand along the
Minter Lagoon spit.  A northward net shore-drift is also indicated by
sediment accumulation on the south side of drift obstructions, erosion
on the north side of bulkhead offsets, and a series of oblique bars
south of the spit at Minter Lagoon.  The terminus of this cell is the
north end of the spit forming the Minter Lagoon; however, some sediment
may periodically pass into Drift Segment 14-1.  North-ward prograding
intertidal bars at the mouth of the lagoon, and a wide shallow sand
shelf extending across the front of the lagoon indicate periodic
sediment bypassing the terminus.
