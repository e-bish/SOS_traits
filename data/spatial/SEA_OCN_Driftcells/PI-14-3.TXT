This short drift cell begins in a zone of diver-gence east of the
entrance to Glen Cove, exhibits westerly net shore-drift, and
termi-nates at a northwesterly prograding recurved spit on the west
side of the entrance to the cove.  The drift direction is demonstrated
by an immediate decrease in sediment size, and a northwesterly increase
in beach width and slope.
