A 2 m till bluff, 150 m south of Camp Seymour, is the diver-gent zone
origin of this drift cell.  Southerly net shore-drift is indicated by a
decrease in sediment size, and accumula-tion of sediment on the north
side of a long bulkhead with erosion on the south side.  The terminus
of this cell is the inner, north side of the spit at the entrance to
Glen Cove.
