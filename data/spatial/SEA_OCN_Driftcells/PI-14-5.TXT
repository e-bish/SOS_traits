This drift cell originates 150 m south of Camp Seymour and terminates
in a small embayment 75 m south of the camp.  Net shore-drift is
demonstrated by a northerly decrease in sediment size, and a slight
increase in beach width and beach slope to the north.  A sand lobe is
accreting at the point where the shoreline turns toward the east into
the embayment.
