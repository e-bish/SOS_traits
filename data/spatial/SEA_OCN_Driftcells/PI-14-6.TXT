This drift cell is found along the northeast side of Glen Cove.  It
originates 75 m south of Camp Seymour and ends in the mudflat of
northern Glen Cove.  The primary indicators of northward net
shore-drift are a decrease in sediment size and bluff slope, and an
increase in upper fore-shore beach width.
