A northerly net shore-drift is displayed by this drift cell. The
cell origites 250 m north of Von Geldern Cove, and ends in a mudflat area
of north Glen Cove.  Drift is indicated by a series of oblique 
sand bars moving northward in the direction of net shore-drift, an
accumulation of sediment on the south side of a log obstruction 200 m
south of Glen Cove, a northerly decrease in sediment size and bluff
slope, a northerly prograding sand lobe 150-200 m into the cove, and
sediment accumulated on the south side of a concrete culvert 150 m
north of the sand lobe.


The zone of divergence in this cell is characterized by an eroding
sand bluff and undercut bulkheads, fronted by a wave-cut platform in
glacial outwash sands.  North of the origin are boat ramps, bulkhead 
off-sets, and trees fallen across the foreshore, all of these having 
sediment accumulated on the south side.  A wooden bulkhead, located 
midway between Von Geldern Cove and Glen Cove, shows massive erosion 
on the north side.  Two northward prograding spits, Thompson Spit and 
an unnamed spit 1.5 km to the south, offset stream drainage channels 
to the north in the direction of net shore-drift.
Bluff erosion north of Thompson Spit is caused by the deposition of
sediment on the spit and wave refraction around the spit.  Shore-drift
occurring at low tide allows some sediment to continue past Thompson
Spit.
