From a point of origin 500 m east of the Vaughn Bay spit, this drift
cell exhibits easterly net shore-drift, and terminates at the eastern
end of Vaughn Bay.  The drift direction is indicated by consistent
eastward stream channel offsets, and sediment accumulated on the west
side of bulkheads, boat ramps, and log obstructions.  In addition,
there is a slight decrease in mean sediment size toward the east.
