This drift cell begins at an eroding glacial headland on the west side 
of Dutcher Cove, and displays a northerly net shore-drift
until it terminates at a spit across Vaughn Bay).  A
mean decrease in sediment size to the north is demonstrated by beach
material of cobbles and boulders at the zone of divergence, decreasing
in size to a foreshore of small cobbles and pebbles in Section 10.
Additional indicators of a northerly drift direction include sediment
accumulated on the south side of drift obstructions with erosion on
the north side, and a large gravel lobe offsetting a small stream
channel to the north, a decrease in bluff slope, and the long northerly 
prograding spit across the mouth of Vaughn Bay..

The south side of Vaughn Bay, west of Section 2, has undergone 
several instances of shoreline modification (i.e., boat ramp, road, 
bulk-heads).  Considering this development, and several floating docks 
along this shoreline, there isno appreciable net shore-drift evident in 
this area.
