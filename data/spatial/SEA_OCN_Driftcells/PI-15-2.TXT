This short drift cell originates at an eroding glacial headland west of
Dutcher Cove.  The zone of divergence has beach material of
predominantly cobbles and boulders.  The beach material fines in a
north-east direction until reaching a northeast prograding spit
composed of pebbles and sand.  A decrease in bluff slope and increase
in beach slope along this drift cell suggests northeast-ward net
shore-drift.  The terminus of this drift cell is at the northeast tip
of a prograding spit on the west side of Dutcher Cove.  There is no
apparent net shore-drift in the narrow mudflats of the northern portion
of Dutcher Cove.
