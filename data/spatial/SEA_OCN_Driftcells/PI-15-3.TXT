The origin of this drift cell is a zone of divergence north-west of
Herron.  A northerly net shore-drift is evidenced along this coastal
stretch by several excellent indica-tors.  Northward from the
diver-gence are numerous bulkhead offsets and boat ramps with quite
voluminous accumulations of sediment on the south side; these drift
obstructions also show evidence of erosion on the north side.  Sediment
moving north builds up the foreshore, increasing the beach width and
slope.  A north-ward prograded spit, 700 m south of Dutcher Cove,
originally offset the lagoon channel outlet to the north, but has been
modified into a small dam. Finally, at the terminus of the drift cell
there is a gravel spit prograding to the north from the east side of
Dutcher Cove.
