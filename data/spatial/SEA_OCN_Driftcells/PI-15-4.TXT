This short drift cell begins northwest of Herron.  The zone of
divergence is a 5 m till cliff, fronted by a wave-cut platform in till
covered by a thin veneer of cobbles and a few boulders.  Southerly net
shore-drift is indicated by diminishing bluff slope, and a fining of
the sediment to the south.  Additional indicators are demonstrated by
sediment accumulated on the north side of drift obstructions, and a
southward pro-grading spit into the cove at Herron.
