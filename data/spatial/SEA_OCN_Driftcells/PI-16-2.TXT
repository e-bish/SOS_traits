This segment is the north part and zone of diver-gence of a drift cell
terminating at the southwest end of Von Geldern Cove.  The origin,
characterized by an eroding sandy bluff, provides sediment for a series
of oblique bars beginning north of Von Geldern Cove and migrating
southerly along the coastline across a wide wave-cut platform on the
northern entrance to the cove.  Additional indicators include erosion
on the southwest end of bulk-heads, sediment accumulation on the north
side of boat ramps, bulkhead offsets, and other drift obstructions.
Sediment moving southerly, in the direction of net shore-drift, is
transported across the wave-cut platform and deposited on the lee side,
forming a large sandy shelf
