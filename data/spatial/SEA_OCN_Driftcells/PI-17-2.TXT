Herron Island

This drift cell begins in a zone of divergence along the northwest tip
of Herron Island.  Eastward net shore-drift is indicated by an easterly
decrease in bluff slope and sediment size, increase in beach slope and
width, and a slight easterly offset of a stream channel.  The drift
cell terminates at a cuspate spit on the northeast tip of the island.
