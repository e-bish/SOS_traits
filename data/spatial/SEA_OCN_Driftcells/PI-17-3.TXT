Herron Island

Beginning at a zone of divergence along the south end of Herron Island,
this drift cell exhibits northerly net shore-drift, termi-nating at a
cuspate spit on the northeast tip of the island.  Cobble -and
boulder-size beach material at the divergence gradually decreases in
size to a sand and shell beach material at the terminus.  Sediment
accumu-lated on the south side of drift obstructions, a northerly
decrease in bluff slope, and increase in beach slope is further
evidence of a northerly net shore-drift.
