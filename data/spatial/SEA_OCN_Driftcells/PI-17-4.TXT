Herron Island

The origin of this drift cell is a 15 m bluff at the south end of
Herron Island.  Northerly net shore-drift is indicated by a 150 m
northward prograding spit on the southwest corner of the island.  North
of the spit sediment fines and is accumulated on the south side of
wooden bulkhead offsets.  The terminus of this drift cell is at a
westward prograding cuspate spit, midway on the west side of the
island.
