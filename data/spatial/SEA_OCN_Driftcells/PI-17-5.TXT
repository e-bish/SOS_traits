Herron Island

Originating at the northwest tip of Herron Island, this drift cell
exhibits southward net shore-drift.  A predominantly cobble and boulder
beach material at the diver-gence gradually gives way to pebble and
sand at the tip of a cuspate spit, 0.9 km south of the origin.
Additional indicators of a southerly net shore-drift include a decrease
in bluff slope, an increase in beach width and slope, and sediment
built up on the north side of a boat ramp just north of the cuspate
spit.
