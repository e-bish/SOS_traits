This segment is a southern portion of a drift cell originating west of
Taylor Bay (Map PI-20) and terminating near Herron (Map PI-15).
Northerly net shore-drift is exhibited by a number of indicator along
this coastline.  An eroding sand bluff at Joemma Beach (now Robert F.
Kennedy State Park) provides beach material for a long sandy beach
extending north of the pier for 1 km.  At the end of this sand beach
there is a northward prograding spit fronting a lagoon which is drained
at the north end of the spit.  A spit prograded across the mouth of
Whiteman Cove has been modified at the north end.  Two large outlet
culverts on the seaward side of the barrier beach have sediment
accumulated on the south side and spilling over the obstruction onto
the north side.  Along the coastal stretch south of Whiteman Cove
sediment is built up on the south side of drift obstructions, and there
are several cusp-type sand and gravel bars with the seaward ends hooked
northward in the direction of net shore-drift.
