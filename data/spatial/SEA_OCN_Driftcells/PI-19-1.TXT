This drift cell originates south of South Head and terminates at
a cuspate spit, Driftwood Point. in Section 18.   Wave induced
erosion has developed a steep, unstable bluff fronted by
a wave-cut platform, and left a thin veneer of cobbles covering
the foreshore. Evidence of a southerly drift direction includes
numerous small stream channels consistently offset to the south, a
southerly decrease in bluff slope, and sediment accumulated on the
north side of drift obstructions.
