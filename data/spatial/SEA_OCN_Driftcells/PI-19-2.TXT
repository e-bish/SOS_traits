This drift cell originates in a zone of diver-gence north-east of
Mahnckes Point.  Northeasterly net shore-drift is exhibited along this
coastal stretch, terminating at a cuspate spit (Driftwood Point).
Evidence of northward shore-drift is demonstrated by sediment
accumulated on the south side of bulkhead offsets and a northerly
decrease in bluff slope and sediment size.  Beach material of cobbles
and boulders northeast of Mahnckes Point gradually decreases in size to
sand and granules on Driftwood Point.  A series of oblique sand bars
are located along a coastal stretch of 0.5 km to 1.5 km north of
Mahnckes Point, contributing to the evidence of norther-ly net
shore-drift.
