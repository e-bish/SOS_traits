Originating at a zone of divergence northeast of Mahnckes Point, this
drift cell exhibits westward, then norther-ly, net shore-drift, and
terminates at the north end of Filucy Bay.  A northerly prograding spit
on Mahnckes Point, sediment accumulation on the south side of drift
obstruc-tions, and a northerly decrease in mean sediment size,
demonstrate the north-ward direction of net shore-drift.
