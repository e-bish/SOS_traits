This drift cell originates on the east side of a southward projecting
promontory north of the Longbranch Marina.  The steep bluff and coarse
sediment gradually give way to a gently sloping bluff and fine
sedi-ment to the north.  Erosion is occurring on the north end of a few
bulkhead offsets, and sedi-ment is accumulated on the south side of
drift obstructions.
