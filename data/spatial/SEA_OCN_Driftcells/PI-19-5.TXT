The net shore-drift of this drift cell is first to the south, then to
the north.  Originating on the east side of a promontory projecting to
the south (west side of Section 24), the net shore-drift is terminated
in a small cove adjacent to Longbranch.  The drift direction is
indicated by a decrease in mean sediment size, sediment accumulated on
the north side of drift obstructions, and an accreting sand lobe at the
tip of the Promontory-.  The extreme west side of Filucy Bay exhibits
no appreciable net shore--drift due to the numerous moorage facilities
and boathouse anchorages, dampening the wave energy.
