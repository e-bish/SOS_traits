This drift cell originates along a coastal stretch oppo-site the west
side of Mahnckes Point.  A northerly, then westerly, net shore-drift is
indicated by sediment accumu-lated on the south side of a bulkhead
offset and erosion on the north side, a north and west decrease in
sediment size, and an accreting sand lobe at the westward curve in the
coastline, the lee side of the promontory.
