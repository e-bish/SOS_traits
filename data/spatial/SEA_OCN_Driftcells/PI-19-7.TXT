From a zone of divergence across from Mahnckes Point, this drift cell
exhibits southeasterly net shore-drift, and terminates in the south end
of Filucy Bay.  The southeasterly net shore-drift is demon-strated by
sediment accumulated on the north side of drift obstructions, stream
channels offset to the south, and a small intertidal spit prograding
southeastward into the southernmost part of the bay.
