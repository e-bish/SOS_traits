This short drift cell originates along South Head and terminates at a
cuspate spit developed on the lee side of the South Head peninsula.  An
immediate decrease in sediment size and increase in beach slope and 
beach width indicate a southerly net shore-drift.  Additional dirft 
indicators include sediment accumulated on the north side of a 
wooden ramp, erosion at the south end of a wooden bulkhead, and an
easterly prograding cuspate spti.  The presence of a cuspate spit
is the result of the convergence of two drift cells, 19A-10 and 
19A-11.
