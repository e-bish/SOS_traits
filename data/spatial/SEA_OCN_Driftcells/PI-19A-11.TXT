From an origin 1 km south of South Head, this drift cell exhibits 
northerly net shore-drift, and terminates at a cuspate spit on the 
lee side of South Head. Northerly net shore-drift is indicated by a 
decrease in sediment size, a northerly increase in beach width, and
the presence of an easterly prograding cuspate spit.
