The origin of this drift cell is at a zone of divergence.  Beginning at
the end of an eroding glacial headland between Von Geldern Cove and
Mayo Cove, this drift cell exhibits southwesterly net shore-drift.
Evidence of this drift direction is demonstrated by erosion on the
southwest side of bulkheads, a sediment size decrease and beach width
increase to the southwest, and small prograded sand beach forms in the
lee of the coast protecting the beach from the predominant
west-northwesterly waves.  The drift cell terminates at a small
accreting line of sediment beneath a bridge crossing to west end of Von
Geldern Cove.
