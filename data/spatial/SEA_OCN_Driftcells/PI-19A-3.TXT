This drift cell begins along an eroding glacial headland between Von
Geldern Cove and Mayo Cove.  The divergence zone is an eroding till
bluff fronted by a beach of predominately cobbles and an occasional
boulder.  To the south, in the direction of net shore-drift, the
sediment fines to sand and pebbles.  A groin field, north of Mayo Cove,
has sediment accumulated on the north sides, as do numerous boat
launches.  A southward prograded tombolo connects the mainland to a
small island.  The terminus of this drift cell is a southwest
prograding recurved spit at the south end of the island and tombolo.
The recurved spit, island, and tombolo are shown as one landform on Map
PI-19A.
