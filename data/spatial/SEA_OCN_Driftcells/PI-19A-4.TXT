Beginning on the north side of Mayo Cove, this drift cell exhibits a
southwest net shore-drift, and terminates at a small intertidal spit
southeast of Lakebay.  The origin is an eroded bluff with beach
material predominately of cobbles.  Further south, the cobbles
gradually decrease in size to pebbles and sand, finally giving way to
sand and silt at the terminus.  Numer-ous boat ramps and bulkhead
offsets have sediment accumu-lated on the northeast side and minor
erosion on the southwest side.
