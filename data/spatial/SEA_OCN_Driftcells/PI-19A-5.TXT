The zone of divergence of this drift cell is along an eroding glacial
headland near the center of Penrose Point State Park.  Sediment fining
to the west and accumulating on the east sides of groins indicates a
westerly direction of net shore-drift.  Additional evidence of a
westerly drift direc-tion includes rapid erosion at the west end of the
bulkhead protecting the promontory, and a westerly prograding spit on
the south side of Mayo Cove.  The drift cell terminates at the end of
the pro-grading spit where a series of groins have been built to
prograde the beach.  These groins are a fine example of the
non-destructive use of such coastal engineering devices.
