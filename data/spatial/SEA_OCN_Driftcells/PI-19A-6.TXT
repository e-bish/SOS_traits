This very short drift cell is approximately 50 m long.  The zone of
divergence is located along an eroding glacial headland near the center
of Penrose Point State Park.  Terminat-ing 50 m to the south, the
shore-drift deposits sediment along the beach at the main recreation
area of the park.  The southerly net shore-drift is demonstrated by an
immediate decrease in sediment size, increase in beach width, and
erosion on the south side of the bulkhead protecting the headland.
