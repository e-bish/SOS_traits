Located at the end of Penrose Point, this drift cell diverges from an
eroding glacial headland fronted by a wide wave-cut plat-form.  A
southerly decrease in sediment size and bluff slope, and an increase in
beach slope, indicate a southerly direction of net shore-drift.
Additional evidence of drift direction includes sediment accumulated on
the north side of drift obstructions, and an impounded lagoon with a
drainage channel offset to the south by a prograding spit.  The
terminus of this drift cell is at the beach embayment fronting the main
recreational area of Penrose Point State Park.
