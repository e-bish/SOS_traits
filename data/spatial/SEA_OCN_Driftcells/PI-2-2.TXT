This short drift cell originates at an approximately 70 m wide zone of
divergence beginning 10 m north of the Commencement Bay Marina.  This
zone is characterized (see Drift Cell 2-1) by a low, eroding bank and a
wide, gently sloping sand shelf.  The terminus of this drift cell lies
just within the marina facility.  Net shore-drift is evidenced by a
slowly accreting wedge of sand beneath the marina piers, and an
increasing foreshore slope south of the zone of divergence.  The marina
docks, boathouse, and other floating facilities disrupt and dampen the
waves needed for sediment transport farther into the marina.  An area
of no appreciable net shore-drift exists along the low land Port of
Tacoma facilities and the numerous waterways situated there.  Dredge
and fill operations, undertaken since the early 1900s, have
successfully trans-formed the entire delta front of the Puyallup River
into a deep water port.  The shoreline is heavily modified with a steep
descent into Commencement Bay.
