This small drift cell exists between two facilities built out into deep
water.  Beginning just south of the old Top of the Ocean restau-rant
pier and pilings, the net shore-drift moves southeasterly, termi-nating
on the northwest side of Commencement Park.  Evidence for a
south-easterly drift is shown by increasing upper foreshore width and
beach slope, and sand accumula-tion toward Commencement Bay Park.
During periods of storm condi-tions, some sediment may be moved past
the terminus, but is lost to the deep (60 m) water just south-east of
the park.
