Originating approximately 300 m southeast of the American Smelting and
Refining Company (ASARCO) this drift cell displays a southeaster-ly
direction of net shore-drift.  One hundred meters south of the drift
cell origin is a disintegrating concrete foundation with an
accumulation of sediment on the northwest side, and minor erosion on
the southeast side.  Along a 2.5 km stretch of coastline to the
southeast, numerous commercial establish-ments are built out across the
foreshore from the heavily modified shoreline.  Sediment accumulates on
the northwest side of the obstructions, but can bypass these, during
storm conditions, along a narrow shelf at the extreme lower foreshore.
This type of drift transport continues southeasterly until terminating
in the area of the old Dickman Lumber Company premises, which projects
farthest offshore and past the extreme lower foreshore shelf.
