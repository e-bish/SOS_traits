
This drift cell originates at an eroding sand bluff located in 
the wind shadow of a spit adjacent to the Drayton Light Buoy 
(in Section 36). Northerly net shore-drift is indicated by a series of
small oblique sand bars, an increase in beach width, and sediment
accumulated on the south side of a public boat launch (72nd Street) 
and other drift obstructions.  At periods of spring low tide, a sandy 
shelf is exposed along the lower foreshore extending to the point of 
the spit north of this divergence.  During this time, sediment moving
north through Drift Cell 20-3 by passes the divergence zone and 
continues north.



The old McDermott Point Lighthouse was located here on an accreting 
lobe of sediment prograding northward.  Sediment bypasses this lobe,
continuing south, to form a south-westerly prograding spit into the
mudflat at the south end of Filucy Bay.
