This drift cell originates along an eroding sand bluff (Section 36),
exhibits a southerly net shore-drift, and terminates on the north side
of a spit adjacent to the Drayton Light Buoy.  The drift direction is
indicated by southerly prograding sand lobes, an accumulation of sand
on the north side of the spit, and an increase in beach slope.  During
periods of spring low tides sediment moving north through Drift Cell
20-3 bypasses this drift cell and continues northward into Cell 20-1.
