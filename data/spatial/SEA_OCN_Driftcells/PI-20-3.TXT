The zone of divergence of this drift cell is located along Devils
Head.  Northerly net shore-drift is indicated by a decrease in mean
sediment size and bluff slope, a prograding sediment lobe on the south
side of a bulkhead offset and boat ramp, and a large northeasterly
prograding spit adjacent to the Drayton Light Buoy.  The terminus of
the drift cell is the large spit; however, during periods of spring low
tides some sediment moves around the end of this spit, bypassing Cell
20-2, and continues north through Cell 20-1.
