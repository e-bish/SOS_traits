This drift cell originates in a zone of divergence along Devils Head,
exhibiting a northerly net shore-drift, and terminating in Taylor Bay.
Three northerly prograding spits and a barrier beach, built from north
to south, are the primary indicators of not shore-drift.  The barrier
beach, located in a lowland area just northwest of Devils Head
currently has a breach at the south end, possibly the result of natural
or artificial lagoon overflow at this point.  This breach is being
rebuilt from the south and is shown as a northerly prograding spit on
historical maps.  Additional indicators of drift direction include
sediment accumulated on the south side of drift obstructions, a
decrease in sediment size, and still another lagoon drainage channel
offset to the north.
