An eroding till bluff west of Taylor Bay is the origin of this drift
cell.  Easterly net shore-drift is indicated by a decrease in sediment
size and bluff slope, sediment accumulated on the east side of bulkhead
offsets, and a prograding sediment lobe offsetting a stream channel
toward the east.  The terminus of this drift cell is in a mudflat at
the east end of Taylor Bay.
