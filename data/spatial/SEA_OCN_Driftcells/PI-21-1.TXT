This drift cell originates northwest of Thompsons Cove and terminates at
a northeasterly pro-grading complex spit in Amsterdam Bay.  A north-
westerly drift direction is indicated by a decrease in mean sediment size, 
sediment accumulated on the southeast side of drift obstructions, and 
an increase in beach width and slope.

The net shore-drift of this cell is north-west for the first approximately
2.5 km, then northeast for 1.5 km.  Beginning in Section 18, the net shore-
drift is indicated by sediment accumulated on the south-east side of log 
obstructions, a northwest prograding spit in Carson Bay, a series of oblique 
sand bars around Treble Point, and an increase in beach width, as well as a 
decrease in sediment size and bluff slope.  The complex spit at the terminus 
offsets a lagoon drainage channel to the north.
