From an origin just northwest of Amsterdam Bay, this drift cell
displays a southeasterly net shore-drift, and terminates in Amsterdam
Bay.  The drift direction is demon-strated by a prograding lobe of
sediment offsetting a stream channel to the east, erosion at the
south-east end of a bulkhead opposite the complex spit in Amsterdam
Bay, and a decrease in bluff slope and mean sediment size.
