Originating in a zone of divergence, east of Amsterdam Bay, this drift
cell exhibits northerly, then easterly, net shore-drift.  Two northerly
prograding spits, and a series of oblique bars, in Section 31, are the
primary indicators of a northerly drift direction.  Indicators of an
easterly drift direction include a sand wedge accumulating in the lee
of Otso Point, sediment built up on the west side of a boat ramp and
bulk-head offset, and an increase in the beach slope and width.  This
cell termi-nates in an accreting sand spit located in a small cove 200
m southeast of Otso Point.
