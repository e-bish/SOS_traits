Originating along a till bluff, opposite Eagle Island, this drift cell
displays an easterly net shore-drift, and terminates 200 m west of
Johnson Landing.  The drift direction is indicated by a westerly
decrease in sediment size, an increase in beach slope and width, and a
prograding sand spit at the terminus.
