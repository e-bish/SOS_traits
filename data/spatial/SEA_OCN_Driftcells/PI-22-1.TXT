This drift cell originated along a wide zone of divergence approximately
1 km south of Yoman Point.  The divergence zone is characterized by an 
exposed till bluff fronted by a fore-shore of cobbles and an occasional 
boulder.  To the north, toward Yoman Point and Johnson Landing, the 
sediment size gradually decreased to predominantly cobbles and pebbles 
as the foreshore gradually widens and steepens.  The northerly, then westerly, 
net shore-drift is demonstrated by two west-ward prograding spits east 
of Johnson Landing, and sediment accumulated on the south and east sides 
of groins, bulkhead offsets, and other drift obstructions.  The terminus of 
the cell is in a small cove 200 m west of Johnson Landing.
