This short drift cell originates east of Thompson Cove, exhibits a
northwesterly net shore-drift, and termi-nates in Thompson Cove.  The
direction of drift is indicated by an increase in beach slope and
width, a decrease in sediment size and bluff slope, and a
northwester-ly prograding spit in Thompson Cove.
