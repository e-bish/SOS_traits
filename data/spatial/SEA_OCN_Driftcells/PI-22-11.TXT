The origin of this cell is a steep bluff west of Thompson Cove.  A
decrease in mean sediment size and bluff slope, an increase in beach
width and slope, sediment accumulated on the west sides of drift
obstructions, and erosion on the east end of a bulkhead indicate an
easterly net shore-drift.  This drift cell terminates at an easterly
prograding spit in Thompson Cove.
