Originating along a wide zone of divergence, north of Sandy Point, this
drift cell exhibits a southerly net shore-drift, and terminates at
Sandy Point, a cuspate spit.  Indicators of the drift direc-tion
include a southerly offset in a marshy lagoon drainage channel, a
southerly increase in beach width and slope, sediment accumulated on
the south side of a bulkhead and boat ramp at the Riviera boat launch,
and the easter-ly prograding cuspate spit at Sandy Point.
