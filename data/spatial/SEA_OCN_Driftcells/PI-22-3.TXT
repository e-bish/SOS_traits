This drift cell originates at a zone of diver-gence south-west of Cole
Point.  The net shore-drift direction is northerly to Sandy Point.
Sediment bypasses Cole Point, which is an eroding glacial headland
(south side) fronted by an accumula-tion of sediment, fining from the
south side to the north side.  A concrete culvert and several logs
across the foreshore have sediment accumulated on the south side.  An
eroding sand and till bluff midway between Cole Point and Sandy Point
contrib-utes sedi-ment to the foreshore which gradually decreases in
size toward the tip of Sandy Point.
