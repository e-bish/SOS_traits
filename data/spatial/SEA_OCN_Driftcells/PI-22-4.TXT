From a point of origin southwest of Cole Point, this drift cell
exhibits a westerly net shore-drift.  Beginning at the zone of
diver-gence, cobble- and boulder-size beach material gradually
decreases in size to sand and silt near the northern end of East Oro
Bay.  Additional indicators of the drift direction include a barrier
beach, built east to west, a decrease in bluff slope, sediment
accumulated on the east side of bulkhead offsets, and an increase in
beach width.  The terminus of this cell is at the end of an intertidal
spit prograding to the west across the north end of East Oro Bay.
