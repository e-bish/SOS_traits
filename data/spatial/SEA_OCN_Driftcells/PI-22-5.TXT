This drift cell originates along the easterly tip of the land
separating Oro Bay from East Oro Bay.  Northerly net shore-drift is
indicated by a decrease in sediment size and a small intertid-al spit
prograding into the north end of East Oro Bay.  The terminus of this
drift cell is in the mudflat at the end of East Oro Bay.
