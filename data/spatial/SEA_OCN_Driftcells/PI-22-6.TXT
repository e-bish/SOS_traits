The origin of this drift cell is a point of land separating Oro Bay
from East Oro Bay.  The net shore-drift is to the west, rounding the
point to the southwest, then northerly to the north end of Oro Bay.
Much of the sediment is accumulating in the embayment between the two
points, but enough material gets around the southwesterly point to have
small accumula-tions of sediment on the south side of drift
obstructions and at an intertidal spit at the north end of Oro Bay.
The terminus of the drift cell is at the north end of Oro Bay.  The
west side of Oro Bay has a 1-3 m clay bank.  Very little sediment is
being added to the foreshore, and there is no evidence for net
shore-drift.  This coastal area is best described as an area of no
appreciable net shore-drift.
