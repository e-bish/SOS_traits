Evidence of minor northerly net shore-drift begins approxi-mately
150-200 m south of the northward projecting point into Oro Bay.  Minor
erosion on the north side of a bulkhead and exposed tree roots, and a
small intertidal spit of silt and clay flakes at the tip of the point
of land indicate the drift direction.  A very low area of land, crossed
by Lyle Point Road, allows the predominant southwesterly winds to
affect this drift cell more than the northwest winds.  Sediment derived
from mass wasting of the shore bluff is transported predominantly
offshore rather than as shore-drift.
