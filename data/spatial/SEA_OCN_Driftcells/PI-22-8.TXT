This short drift cell has a northerly net shore-drift at high tide.
This coastal stretch is fronted by a short gravel spit and a long
intertidal sand spit that blocks the wave action at low tide.
Northerly drift direction is indicated by a minor amount of erosion on
the northwest side of fallen trees and exposed roots, and sedi-ment of
silt and clay flakes accumu-lated on a small intertidal spit projecting
into Oro Bay.
