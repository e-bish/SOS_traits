From a point of origin east of Thompson Cove, this drift cell proceeds
in a northerly direction around Lyle Point, terminating at a
north-westerly gravel and sand spit at the north tip of the Lyle Point
area.  Northerly net shore-drift is demonstrated by a decrease in
sediment size and bluff slope, an increase in beach height and slope, a
lagoon drainage channel offset to the north at Lyle Point by an
accreting arcuate beach form, and a northwesterly prograding complex
spit at the termi-nus.
