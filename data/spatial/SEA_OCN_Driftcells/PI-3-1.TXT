This short segment includes the zone of divergence for drift cell 2-4.
  Indicators of the extent of the divergent zone are very subtle
due to the constant dumping of debris over the edge of the shore bank.
Sediment along this coastal stretch is predominantly cobble-size or
larger, and recent asphalt and concrete debris dumped over the bank
show signs of undercutting and collapse.
