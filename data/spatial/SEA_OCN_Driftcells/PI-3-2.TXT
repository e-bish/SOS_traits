Beginning at a zone of divergence approximately 300 m south-east of the
American Smelting and Refining Company (ASARCO), this short drift cell
terminates at ASARCO's southeast border.  The plant sits on a slag
fill, built out into deep water, impeding sediment movement.  A small
accumulation of sediment against the fill and an erosional area
immediately northwest of a pile of debris, approximately 150 m
southeast of ASARCO, indicate a northerly direction of net
shore-drift.

North of Drift Cell 3-2, there is a coastal stretch 700 m long made up
of waste slag dumped out into deep water.  This produces fill material
for the expansion of the ASARCO plant, the Tacoma Yacht Club, and for
harboring the Warter Marina.  Extending 200 m north of this area there
is further modi-fication of the shoreline by multiple piers, docks, and
riprap in Point Defiance Park.  Both of these coastal stretches are
areas of no appreciable net shore-drift.
