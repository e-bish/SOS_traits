From a point of origin located just northwest of the old site of the
Point Defiance Aquarium, this drift cell has northerly net shore--drift
terminating at the tip of Point Defiance.  An indicator of northerly
drift is a minor accumulation of sediment on the southeast side of a
boat ramp at Owens Beach.  Further evidence includes a northerly
decrease of mean sediment size, and an increase of beach width and
slope.  These trends con-tinue until an area of severe cliff erosion
250 m north of Owens Beach, which contributes large quantities of sand
to the foreshore.  The sand, as well as other sediment, is transported
to the tip of Point Defiance where it is moved offshore by waves and
tidal currents into a sediment sink reaching a depth of 70 m.
