This segment is the northern part of a drift cell originating near the
Titlow Lagoon and terminating at the tip of Point Defiance.  Norther-ly
net shore-drift is indicated by consistent sediment accumulation on the
south side of rock obstructions.  A riprapped shoreline extends from
south of the map area to a point just south of Salmon Beach.
Additional drift indica-tors are evidenced here by erosion at the north
end of the riprap and sediment accumulation on the south side of the
southern-most residence at Salmon Beach.  Continuing northwesterly
beyond Salmon Beach, numerous log obstructions have sediment
accumulated on the southeast side.  Sediment moves northerly,
termina-ting at Point Defiance, where tidal currents and wave action
move it offshore into a sediment sink.
