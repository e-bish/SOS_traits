Originating at a small zone of divergence west of the Titlow Lagoon,
this segment displays a northerly direction of net shore-drift that
terminates at Point Defiance.  There are two excellent
indicators of net shore-drift in this segment.  The first indicator is
located at the Tacoma Outboard Association (TOA) boat launch, where
there is a large groin with a vertical offset of 1.5 m of sediment
accumulated on the south side; and secondly, 1 km north of TOA there is
a sediment wedge built up on the south side of a concrete
sewage-outfall pipe.
