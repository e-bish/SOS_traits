This short drift cell, originating west of the Titlow Lagoon, is a
local reversal of sediment drift terminating near the Narrows Marina.
In this cell southerly net shore-drift is indicated by a southerly
offset of the Titlow Lagoon drainage channel, upper foreshore width and
slope increase, and mean sediment size decrease in a southerly
direction.  Very little sediment has reached the marina due to the
small initial source of sediment input and a heavily modified shoreline
of bulkheads, piers, pilings and marina facilities.
