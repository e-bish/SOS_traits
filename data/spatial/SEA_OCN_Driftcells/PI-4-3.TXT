The origin of this drift cell is a zone of divergence located along a
heavily modified shoreline in the vicinity of the Steilacoom ferry
landing.  Progressing northerly from the zone of divergence the drift
indi-cators include sediment accumulation on the southwest side of a
concrete drain-pipe (in Steilacoom), erosion on the north end of a
wooden bulkhead at Sunnyside Beach, small northerly prograding sand
spits off the north ends of both Glacier and Lone Star sand and gravel
companies' barge loading docks, sediment accumu-lation on the south
sides of groins at Sunset Beach and the west side of Days Island, and a
northerly prograding recurved spit at the north end of Days Island.
The terminus of this cell is the Days Island Marina, located between
Days Island and the mainland.  Periodic dredging of this area is
required to keep it functional as a boat moorage facility.
