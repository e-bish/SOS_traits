Net shore-drift is to the southwest in this small drift cell.
Originating at a zone of divergence along a heavily modified shoreline
near the Steilacoom ferry landing, this cell terminates at Gordon
Point, a cuspate spit.  The net shore-drift is indicated by a
southwesterly decrease in mean sediment size and increase in beach
slope, and the presence of a prograding cuspate spit at Gordon Point.
