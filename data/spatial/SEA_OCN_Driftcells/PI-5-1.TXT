This drift cell, originating south of Solo Point 
has a northerly net shore-drift terminating at Gordon Point,
 a cuspate spit.  Large rock obstructions on the upper foreshore consistently
have an accumula-tion of sediment on the south side, as do numerous
drainage pipes crossing the beach face.  Signifi-cant indicators of
northerly net shore-drift are the asymmetric delta fronts of two
unnamed streams at Solo Point and 800 m south of Gordon Point.  A
northerly drift direction is demonstrated at each delta by the
accumulation of sediment on the south side of the fan, causing the
asymmetric shape, and a northerly offset of the drainage channels.
