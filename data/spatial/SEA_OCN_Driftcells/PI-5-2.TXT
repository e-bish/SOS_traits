Originating northeast of Tatsolo Point, this drift cell exhibits a
southwesterly net shore-drift, and terminates at Tatsolo Point.  The
cell is a short reversal in a mostly northern drift pattern, existing
in the wind shadow of Tatsolo Point.  The southwest net shore-drift is
demon-strated by a 250-300 m stretch of beach, significantly increasing
in width, slope, and height toward Tatsolo Point.
