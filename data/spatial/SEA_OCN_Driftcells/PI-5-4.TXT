A zone of divergence, at the northeast tip of Ketron Island, is the
origin of this drift cell.  Southerly net shore-drift is demonstrated
by a decrease in mean sediment size, increase in beach width, and
sediment accumulated on the north side of a boat ramp and a row of
pilings north of the ferry landing.  The terminus of this cell is a
sandy cuspate spit, prograding to the east from a promontory just south
of the ferry landing.  Sediment occasionally comes into this drift cell
from a cell terminating at the north end of the island (see Drift Cell
5-6 and 5-7).
