This drift cell originates at the south end of Ketron Island, exhibits
a northerly net shore-drift, and terminates at a sandy cuspate spit
just south of the ferry landing.  The sediment, moving north, bypasses
two arcuate prograding beach forms (may be mistaken for cuspate
spits).  It is noteworthy that the sediment on the north side of each
form is smaller in size than the sediment on the south side.
Additional indicators of the drift direc-tion are an increase in beach
slope, decreasing bluff slope, and sediment accumulated on the south
sides of log obstructions.
