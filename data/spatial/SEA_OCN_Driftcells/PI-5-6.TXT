A zone of divergence, on the south end of Ketron Island, is the
beginning of this drift cell.  The northerly net shore-drift is
indi-cated by a decrease in mean sediment size, increase in beach width
and slope, and a northward prograding spit offsetting a lagoon drainage
channel to the north.  Addition-ally, a modified coastline, north of
the lagoon, is being eroded away at the north end, and sediment has
accumulated on the south side of this and other drift obstructions.
The terminus of this cell is a cuspate spit at the north end of the
island.  Some sediment occasionally bypasses the spit and encroaches on
a divergence zone to the east, moving into Drift Cell 5-4 (see Drift
Cell 5-7).
