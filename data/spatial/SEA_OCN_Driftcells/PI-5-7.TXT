The origin of this short cell is a divergent zone on the northeast side
of Ketron Island.  This zone is character-ized by a steep till bluff
fronted by a wave-cut platform.  A relatively small amount of sediment
is transported in the western net shore-drift directions due to its
location and relationship to the island topography and predominant
waves.  Wave energy here is sufficient to maintain the cuspate spit
formed at the northwest tip of the island.  A westerly net shore-drift
direction is indicated by an increase in beach slope and width, and the
presence of a cuspate spit at the terminus of the cell.
