The origin of this segment is a zone of divergence located 750- 800 m
south of Sequalitchew Creek.  The northerly net shore-drift is
indicated by a slight decrease in mean sediment size, and sediment
buildup on the south-west sides of rock ob-structions and a
concrete-block culvert draining Sequa-lit-chew Creek.  An asymmetrical
delta lobe at Sequalitchew Creek, with sediment accumulation to the
southwest and a drainage channel offset to the north, in addition to an
accumulation of sediment and debris on the southwest  side of the
Dupont Wharf, are further indicators of a northerly net shore--drift.
The beginning of a wind shadow area, north of Tatsolo Point, is the
terminus of this cell.
