Beginning at a zone of divergence 750-800 m south 
of Sequalitchew Creek, this short drift cell has a
southwesterly net shore-drift and terminates at 
the northwest side of the old Foss Tug jetty.  This
drift cell is a short reversal, opposing the general 
northerly trend along this coastal stretch of Pierce
County.  Subtle evidence of this reversal is 
indicated by a southerly decrase in mean sediment 
size, and an increase in beach slope.  The jetty
(built in 1940) causes a wind shadow effect along
the adjacent northern shoreline, from the predominant
west-southwesterly waves, with the waves refracting
its end.
