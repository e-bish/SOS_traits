Indicators for wave-induced net shore-drift begins
approxi-mately 200-250 m south of the Foss Tug jetty.  Logs and rock
falls on the upper foreshore have small amounts of fine sand
accumulated on the south side.  The presence of a small tidal channel
near the shoreline, and paralleling the south side of the jetty, also
contributes to the movement of sediment within this delta area.  The
terminus of this drift cell is the jetty; howev-er, along the western
end of the jetty there is evidence of erosion and overwash fans from
the southwest, allowing some sediment to bypass the jetty.  A study of
the area by the CH2M-Hill consulting company predicts a period of
thirty years to erode this area down to a level of mean lower low
water.  South and west of Drift Cell 6-3 there is a tidal-dominated
delta front of mudflats and marshy lowlands.  No apparent net
shore-drift exists in this area.
