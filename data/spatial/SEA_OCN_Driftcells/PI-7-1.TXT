Beginning 2 km north of Point Richmond, this segment includes the zone
of divergence and the southern part of a drift cell with northerly net
shore-drift.  Evidence of northerly drift is demon-strated by sediment
accumu-la-tion on the south sides of bulkhead offsets and other drift
obstruc-tions, erosion at the north ends of bulkheads, and mean
sediment size decreasing to the north.  The terminus of this cell is at
an unconfirmed point in Kitsap County.
