This drift cell begins at a zone of divergence 2 km north of Point
Richmond and displays a southerly net shore-drift terminating at Point
Richmond, a cuspate spit.  Proceeding from the divergent zone to an
area 300 m to the south (Manson Construction Company), the beach width
increases and mean sediment size fines.  At the Manson Construction
Company site there is a series of rock groins extending out from a flat
riprapped promontory, each groin having an accumulation of sand on the
north side.  Erosion is occurring at the south end of this promontory.
Further to the south, the sediment again fines, the beach slope
increases, and numerous bulkhead offsets and boat ramps have sediment
accumulated on the north side.
