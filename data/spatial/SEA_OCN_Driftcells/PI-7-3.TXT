Originating at a localized zone of divergence, 250 m northeast of the 
entrance to Gig Harbor this drift cell is characterized by northerly
net shore-drift and its terminus is at Point Richmond, a cuspate spit.
Evidence for northerly net shore-drift is demonstrated by sediment
accumula-tion on the south sides of bulkhead offsets and other drift
obstructions, numerous northerly stream channel offsets, and a general
trend of decreasing sedi-ment size and increasing beach slope toward
Point Richmond.  Two excel-lent indicators found in this segment are a
1 m vertical offset of sediment accumulated on the south side of a boat
ramp at the Sea Cliffs Park, and the erosion taking place at the north
end of the wooden bulkhead located at Sunrise Beach County Park.
