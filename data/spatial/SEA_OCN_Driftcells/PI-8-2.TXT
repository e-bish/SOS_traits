This short drift cell begins at a localized zone of diver-gence 250 m
northeast of the entrance to Gig Harbor.  (The location of private
residences close to the edge of this eroding bluff could potentially
prove hazardous to the property owners.)  Net shore-drift to the
southwest is indi-cated by an immediate decrease in mean sediment size,
and increase in beach slope.  A large recurved spit prograding westerly
at the entrance to Gig Harbor is the terminus of this drift cell.
