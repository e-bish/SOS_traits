The zone of divergence of this drift cell is located approxi-mately 350
m north of the entrance to Gig Harbor.  Within this well protected
harbor subtle drift indicators are found demonstrating southeasterly
net shore--drift in this drift cell.  Proceeding to the south from the
divergence zone, the beach slope increases, mean sediment size
decreases, and sediment is accumu-lated on the north sides of bulkhead
offsets with minor erosion occur-ring at the south ends of bulkheads.
The terminus of this cell is the harbor side of the spit at the
entrance to Gig Harbor.
