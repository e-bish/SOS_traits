A northerly net shore-drift is exhibited by this drift cell,
originating at a zone of divergence 350 m north of the Gig Harbor
entrance and terminating at the north end of Gig Harbor.  Indicators of
a northerly net shore-drift include a decrease in mean sediment to the
north, and sediment accumulated on the south side of bulkhead offsets,
boat ramps, and other drift obstructions.

The northwest and southwest sides of Gig Harbor are modified by
numerous marinas, piers, and other commercial establishments built out
over the fore-shore into deep water.  There is no apparent net
shore-drift in this area.
