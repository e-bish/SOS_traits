This drift cell originates at a sandy bluff zone of divergence along a
coastal stretch near Harbor Heights.  Erosion of the sandy bluff has
posed substantial problems for the residents of this area, as witnessed
by the numerous abandoned and boarded up homes along this coastal
stretch.  Northerly net shore-drift is demonstrated by a widening of
the beach, in-creased beach slope, and an accumulation of sediment on
the south sides of drift obstruc-tions.  This cell terminates at an
accreting lobe of sand just within the harbor entrance.
