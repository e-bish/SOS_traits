This cell originates at a zone of divergence along a sand 
bluff near Harbor Heights and terminates at Point Evans.  
The southerly net shore-drift is indicatedby a trend of 
increasing beach width and decreasing bluff slope.


Located on the foreshore near Point Evans there are steeply-dipping 
competent clay and sand beds, across the beach, that have an 
accumulation of sediment on the north side.  Sediment transported 
to Point Evans is ultimately lost offshoreby tidal current and wave 
action.  The tip of Point Evans is undergoing rapid erosion, caused 
by the lack of sediment accumulation and anunprotected bluff base.
