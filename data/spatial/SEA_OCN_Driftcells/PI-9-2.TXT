Beginning at a zone of divergence at Point Fos-dick, this drift cell
exhibits northeasterly net shore-drift.  Immediately northeast of the
divergence zone there is a concrete culvert with sediment accumulated
on the south side and major erosion on the north side.  Proceeding to
the north, there is a stream channel offset to the north and a large
rock groin with sedi-ment accumulated on the south side.  There is also
a general decrease in bluff slope toward the terminus at Point Evans.
Sediment transported to Point Evans is lost offshore by tidal current
and wave action.
