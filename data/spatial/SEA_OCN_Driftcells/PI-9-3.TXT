Originating from a zone of divergence at Point Fosdick, this drift cell 
displays a northerly net shore-drift.  Evidence for this shore-drift 
includes a northwesterly decrease in mean sediment size and an increase 
in beach slope. Additionally, there is a large prograding sand beach 
just west of Point Fosdick.  The drift cell terminates at the north 
end of Wollochet Bay on the south side of Picnic Point.

The drift direction is indicted by numerous groins, bulkhead offsets, and 
boat ramps, with sediment accumulated on the south side.  A northward 
prograding spit at an unnamed creek near Wollochet, and another northward 
prograding spit at Sullivan Gulch are additional indicators of a northerly 
net shore-drift.  Predominately cobble sediment north of Sullivan Gulch 
fines to sand and silt near Picnic Point.  The southwestward projection of 
Picnic Point is sufficient enough to halt most of the fine sediment transported 
by a very weak wave regime.  North of Picnic Point there is a long narrow mudflat.  
No appreciable net shore-drift occurs here.
