Shaw Island quad

This cell is located on the western side of Broken Point near the eastern approach to Wasp Passage.  Net shore-drift is to the northeast in this 400-m-long cell.  Drift sediment is supplied by a stream that discharges into Wasp Passage approximately 100 m west of the base of Broken Point.  The cell originates at this stream mouth.  Northeastward net shore-drift is indicated by northeastward stream mouth offset, northward sediment size decrease and the progradation of the tombolo that connects Shaw Island to Broken Point, and accumulation of sediment on the south side of a rock prominence at the terminus of the cell, located at the northern extent of the tombolo.
