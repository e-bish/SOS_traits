Shaw Island, Friday Harbor quads

No appreciable net shore-drift occurs from Shaw County Park and Squaw Bay, west along San Juan Channel all the way to the western end of Shaw Island (Friday Harbor quadrangle). No appreciable net shore-drift occurs along Wasp Passage as well, until Broken Point. Pocket beaches are present in the many bays and harbors along this portion of Shaw Island, where numerous, rocky headlands prevent continuous shore drift systems from occurring.
