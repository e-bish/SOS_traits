Shaw Island quad

This cell originates at the beginning of a concave beach in western Blind Bay.  The sediment source for this cell is glacial till, occurring at the origin and over most of the length of the cell.  Net shore-drift is generally southward for 0.6 km, depositing at the southern end of the beach.  Generally southward net shore-drift is indicated by decreasing sediment size and stream mouth offset to the south, and accumulation of drift sediment against the northwest side of a rock prominence at the terminus of the cell.
