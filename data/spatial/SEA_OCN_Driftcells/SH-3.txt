Shaw Island quad

This cell exhibits southeastward net shore-drift across the southern shore of Blind Bay.  Glacial till is present over the length of the cell, providing the drift sediment.  Net shore-drift originates on the eastern side of a cluster of rock prominences.  Southeastward net shore-drift is indicated by southeastward offset of a stream mouth, and a slight southeasterly decrease in sediment grain size in the portion of the cell that is southeast of the stream and delta.  The terminus of the cell is located along the beach in southern Blind Bay.
