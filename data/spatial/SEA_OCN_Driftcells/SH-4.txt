Shaw Island quad

This cell is located in southeast Blind Bay with generally southward net shore-drift for 1.1 km.  The origin of the cell is located 0.6 km south-southwest of the Shaw Island ferry terminal.  Drift sediment is derived from eroding deposits of glacial till.  South and southwestward net shore-drift is indicated by progradation of a hooked spit just south of the cell's origin, southward stream mouth offset and sediment size decrease.  The nearshore zone is shoaling in southeast Blind Bay as sand and mud are deposited in this zone of drift convergence.
