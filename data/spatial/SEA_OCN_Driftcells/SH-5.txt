Shaw Island quad

This cell is located in Indian Cove in southeast Shaw Island.  Net shore-drift is eastward across South Beach to Picnic Point.  Bluff erosion is taking place at the origin of the cell at western South Beach, where the glacial drift sediment enters the shore drift system from a poorly-vegetated, eroding bluff.  Bluff vegetation and stability increase and sediment size decreases to the east, indicating eastward net shore-drift.  The low elevation and flat nature of eastern South Beach suggests that it has prograded to the east in the form of a spit in front of two former embayments, creating impounded marshes, and extended to Picnic Point as a tombolo, further indicating eastward net shore-drift.  Beach sediment accumulates against western Picnic Point, which is the terminus of this cell.
