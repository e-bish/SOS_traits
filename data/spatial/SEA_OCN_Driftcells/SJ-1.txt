Roche Harbor

This cell originates 200 m southwest of the rocky headland of eastern Davison Head.  Net shore-drift is to the west for 0.6 km to near the western end of the Davison Head embayment.  Westward net shore-drift is indicated by an increase in beach width (from approximately 8 m to greater than 15 m) over the length of the cell, a westerly decrease in sediment size from pebbles and cobbles to sand, sediment accumulations on the east side of rocks partially interrupting drift, and the progradation of a mid-bay spit at the terminus of the cell near the head of the bay.
