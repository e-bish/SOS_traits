False Bay quad

This cell is located on the eastern shore of False Bay with net shore-drift to the north and northwest into the bay.  False Bay was named for its extreme shallowness; virtually the entire bay is dry at MLLW, consisting of sandy tide flats.  This cell originates 300 m northeast of the narrowest portion of the bay mouth.  Glacial till occurs here, providing part of the drift sediment.  Additional sediment is derived from sand, originally transported to the bay by streams, that is reworked by waves entering the bay from Haro Strait.  Net shore-drift is northward and northwestward for 1.8 km.  Indicators of net shore-drift are northward and northwestward beach width increase, accumulation of sediment on the south side of rock outcrops partially interrupting drift, and nearshore bars oriented east-west, moving onshore to the north.  The terminus of the cell is located in a zone of drift convergence at a stream delta in northernmost False Bay.
