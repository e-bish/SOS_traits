False Bay quad

This cell is located in northwest False Bay and has net shore-drift to the northeast for 0.5 km.  Net shore-drift originates immediately north of several small rock outcrops along an east-facing coastal sector.  Glacial drift and reworked stream deposits provide drift sediment here.  Northeastward net shore-drift is evidenced by an increase in beach width to the northeast, sediment accumulation on the southwest side of rock outcrops partially interrupting drift, and nearshore bars oriented east-west, moving onshore to the northeast. The terminus of the cell is located in a zone of drift convergence near a stream delta in northernmost False Bay.
