False Bay quad

This cell is located in western False Bay with a minimal amount of net shore-drift to the north for 0.4 km.  The cell originates immediately north of the rocky shore present in the entrance to False Bay. Isolated glacial drift deposits and reworked, sand-rich stream deposits comprise the sediment source.  Northward net shore-drift is indicated by northward beach width increase between rock outcrops partially interrupting drift, sediment accumulation on the south side of rock outcrops, and nearshore bars oriented northeast-southwest, moving onshore to the north.  Net shore-drift terminates at an indentation in the shore in westernmost False Bay.
