False Bay, Roche Harbor quads

No appreciable net shore-drift occurs along the coast of Haro Straight from False Bay north to Mitchell Bay, located 2 km south of Henry Island (Roche Harbor quadrangle).  A number of pocket beaches occur along this rocky coast, the largest of which is found in Andrews Bay.
