Roche Harbor quad

This cell is located in southwest Mitchell Bay, with southeastward net shore-drift.  The cell originates immediately southeast of the rocky shore found at the narrowest portion of the entrance to Mitchell Bay. Southeastward net shore-drift is evidenced by rapid southeastward increase in beach width and decrease in sediment size over the 200 m cell.  Net shore-drift terminates at a zone of drift convergence in the vicinity of the Mitchell Bay marina.
