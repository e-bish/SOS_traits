Roche Harbor quad

This cell is located in southern Mitchell Bay with net shore-drift to the northwest.  Net shore-drift originates along a rocky shore 300 m southeast of the Mitchell Bay marina and transports sediment northwest to the zone of drift convergence located at the marina.  Evidence of northwestward net shore-drift is increased beach width and decreased sediment size to the northwest, and accumulation of sediment on the southeast side of a rock outcrop near the beginning of the cell.
