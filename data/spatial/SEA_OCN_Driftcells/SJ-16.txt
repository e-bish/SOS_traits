Roche Harbor quad

This is a 0.5 km cell located in Mitchell Bay with eastward net shore-drift.  Eastward net shore-drift originates 100 m west of the western of two docks on southeast Mitchell Bay, and continues into the southeast corner of the bay.  Indicators of eastward net shore-drift include eastward beach width increase and sediment size decrease, and sediment accumulation on the west side of small rock outcrops near the beginning of the cell.
