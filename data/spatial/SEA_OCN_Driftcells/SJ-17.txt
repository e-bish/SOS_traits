Roche Harbor quad

This 200-m-long cell is located in southeast Mitchell Bay.  The cell originates from a zone of drift divergence present on the eastern shore of Mitchell Bay and has southward net shore-drift.  Evidence of southward net shore-drift is increased beach width and decreased sediment size to the south and accumulation of sediment on the north side of rock outcrops along the northern 200 m of the cell.  The terminus of the cell is located in the southeasternmost corner of the bay, which is shoaling as mud accumulates in the nearshore zone.
