Roche Harbor quad

This cell is found in eastern Mitchell Bay and has northward net shore-drift for 0.7 km.  Net shore-drift originates from a zone of drift divergence at a narrow gravel beach. Net shore-drift is northward, indicated by a substantial northward increase in beach width and decrease in sediment size to sand.  Mud is being deposited in a tide flat in northern Mitchell Bay, the extent of which seems to be increasing.  Net shore-drift terminates at the northern end of the bay.
