Roche Harbor quad

Northeastward net shore-drift originates on the southwest side of the peninsula in the center of Mitchell Bay, where a narrow pebble beach is present.  Net shore-drift passes around the south end of the peninsula and continues to the northeast for 1.2 km to a zone of drift convergence.  Indicators of northeastward net shore-drift are northeastward beach width increase and sediment size decrease to sand.  Net shore-drift terminates at the northern end of the bay.
