Roche Harbor quad

The 0.7-km-long cell originates directly south of the eastern end of Davison Head, at a north-facing coastal sector.  Net shore-drift is to the west to near the head of the Davison Head embayment.  Generally westward net shore-drift is revealed by local beach width increase and sediment size decrease to the west and in the beach that is accumulated on the southeast side of a rocky prominence.  Westward net shore-drift continues around the rocky prominence, showing beach width increase and sediment size decrease, before depositing in a sandy, mid-bay spit 200 m east of the head of the bay.
