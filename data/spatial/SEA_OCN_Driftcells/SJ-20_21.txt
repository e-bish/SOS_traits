Roche Harbor quad

No appreciable net shore-drift occurs from northwestern Mitchell Bay, around Hanbury and Dalcombe Points, to Garrison Bay.  A number of pocket beaches are found along this predominantly rocky coast.  The irregular western and southern shores of Garrison Bay contain several pocket beaches, but also have no appreciable net shore-drift.
