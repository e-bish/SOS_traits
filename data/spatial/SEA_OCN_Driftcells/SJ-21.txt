Roche Harbor quad

This cell is located along the eastern shore of Garrison Bay.  Net shore-drift originates at western Bell Point and goes southeastward for 1.0 km, passing in front of British Camp, part of the San Juan National Historic Park.  Isolated glacial drift deposits are the sediment source for this cell.  Indicators of southeastward net shore-drift are a poorly-vegetated bluff along the first 100 m of the cell, generally increasing beach width to the southeast and sediment accumulations on the northwest side of rock outcrops.  Net shore-drift terminates at a well-vegetated prominence located 400 m northwest of southernmost Garrison Bay, where a tide flat begins.  No appreciable net shore-drift occurs along northern Bell Point and the small prominence 0.5 km east of Bell Point, where several small, isolated beaches occur.
