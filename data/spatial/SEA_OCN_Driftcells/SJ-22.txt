Roche Harbor quad

Generally southwestward net shore-drift along the southern shore of Westcott Bay originates from a zone of drift divergence in common with a cell to the north.  A low bluff comprised of glacial till is the sediment source for this cell.  The lack of full vegetation cover on the low bluff reveals the erosional nature of the bluff, while 100 m southwest the bluff is well-vegetated and stable, indicating southwestward net shore-drift.  Net shore-drift passes shoreward of a large aquaculture facility that is built into the bay in the center of this cell. Increased beach width to the west, along with southward progradation of a sandy, hooked spit at the cell's terminus further indicate generally southwestward net shore-drift.
