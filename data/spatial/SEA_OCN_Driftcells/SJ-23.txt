Roche Harbor quad

Net shore-drift in this originates from a zone of drift divergence in southeast Westcott Bay. Net shore-drift is to the northeast then northwest for 1.2 km, continuing to the head of the bay.  Generally northward net shore-drift is indicated by beach width increase and sediment size decrease towards the head of the bay, northwestward offset of a small stream entering the northeast corner of the bay, and northwestward progradation of a sandy spit.  This spit has prograded approximately 250 m to the northwest, the distal end of the spit is the terminus of this cell.
