Roche Harbor quad

This cell is located in northern Westcott Bay, with net shore-drift to the northeast for 0.4 km.  Net shore-drift here continues in the same direction as that in the adjacent cell to the west, until that cell ends in a tombolo to a rock outcrop.  This cell originates on the northeast side of this rock outcrop, where glacial till is the source of drift sediment. Northeastward net shore-drift is evidenced by increased beach width and decreased sediment size in that direction, sediment accumulation on the southwest side of a rock outcrop and northeastward progradation of a spit at the cell's terminus.
