Roche Harbor quad

This cell is located in northern Westcott Bay and has net shore-drift to the northeast for 0.5 km.  Net shore-drift originates on the northeast side of a large rocky prominence near the center of the bay, where a low bluff composed of glacial till is present.  Northeastward net shore-drift is indicated by northeastward beach width increase and sediment size decrease, sediment accumulations on the southwest side of large trees lying across the beach, and progradation of a 60-m-long tombolo to a rocky feature.  Net shore-drift in this cell terminates at the end of this tombolo.
