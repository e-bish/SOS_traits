Roche Harbor quad

This cell is located northeast of White Point in Westcott Bay and has generally northeastward then southeastward net shore-drift for 1.0 km. The cell originates along northeast White Point, on the north side of two rock outcrops.  A tombolo has prograded to the northeast from a point 200 m north of the cell origin, indicating northeastward net shore-drift.  Other indicators include increasing beach width to the northeast, sediment accumulation on the southwest side of rock outcrops, northeasterly offset of a small stream mouth, and the accumulation of the beach against the west side of a rock outcrop at the terminus of the cell.
