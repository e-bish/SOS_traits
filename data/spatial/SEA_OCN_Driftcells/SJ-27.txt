Roche Harbor quad

This cell is located along Mosquito Pass opposite Henry Island.  Net shore-drift is northward for 400 m.  Net shore-drift originates 400 m north of the southern end of White Point, where glacial till occurs. Indicators of northward net shore-drift are increased beach width and decreased sediment size to the north and the northwestward progradation of an 80-m-long tombolo to a rocky headland that fronts a marsh.  Net shore-drift terminates at the southwest extent of this headland, just beyond the tombolo.
