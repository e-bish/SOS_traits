Roche Harbor quad

This 0.7-km-long cell is located north of Roche Harbor, near the northernmost extent of San Juan Island.  Net shore-drift originates on the southwest side of Davison Head, a rocky headland along Speiden Channel, and goes generally southwestward for 0.7 km.  A tombolo connects Davison Head to San Juan Island near the beginning of this cell.  The tombolo was formed from sediment drifted from the western and eastern ends of Davison Head.  Patchy glacial drift deposits are the source of drift sediment in this area.  Indicators of generally southwestward net shore-drift are the poorly-vegetated bluff faces cut into glacial till present at the drift cell origin and 200 m southwest of the origin, contrasted with a well-vegetated bluff and shore southwest of a location 300 m along the cell, southwestward decrease in sediment size, and accumulation of sediment on the northeast side of a rock outcrop that demarcates the drift cell terminus.
