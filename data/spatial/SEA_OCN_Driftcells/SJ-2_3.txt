Roche Harbor, Friday Harbor, Shaw Island quads

No appreciable net shore-drift occurs along this stretch of San Juan Island.  The rocky coast is resistent to erosion, such that only narrow wave-cut paltforms have developed, and very few glacial deposits are located alongshore. There are numerous isolated sediment accumulations and pocket beaches present along this coast, including Lonesome Cove and Rocky Bay.  Within Friday Harbor, two pocket beaches are found northwest of the town of Friday Harbor, receiving sediment from streams.  The shore in front of and to the east of the town is substantially modified (Shaw Island quadrangle), and presently shows no appreciable net shore-drift.  The shore in eastern Friday Harbor and around to the southern side of the large peninsula east of Friday Harbor is rocky and does not have sufficient volume of glacial deposits or wave energy to have net shore-drift, although many pocket beaches occur here.
