Shaw Island and Friday Harbor quads

This cell is located within North Bay and has generally westward net shore-drift.  The cell originates in northern North Bay at the eastern extent of a bluff composed of outwash sand and gravel (Shaw Island quadrangle), which is the sediment source.  (The cell origin is located at the boundary of the Shaw Island - Friday Harbor quadrangles.)  To the west, the shore has an increasingly well-vegetated bluff backing it and increased beach width, evidencing westward net shore-drift (Friday Harbor quadrangle).  A sand and gravel mining facility is located on the uplands and on Little Island, perhaps adding to the natural sediment supply in this area.  A 400 m sand and gravel spit has prograded southwestward to Little Island, originating at a slight change in shore orientation.  The feature is now a tombolo that also has a recurved spit originating from near Little Island, oriented towards the north-northwest.  Both the tombolo and spit show a progressive decrease in sediment size along their length.  This characteristic, in combination with the progradation of the features, indicates that net shore-drift continues to the end of the recurved spit, where mud is also being deposited in the nearshore area.
