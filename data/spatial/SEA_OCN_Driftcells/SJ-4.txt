Friday Harbor quad

This cell is located within a small embayment in western North Bay, directly southwest of Little Island.  Net shore-drift originates at the southern end of a concave beach between two rocky prominences.  The beach, backed by glacial drift, continues for 0.5 km to the north. Glacial drift deposits and a small stream located near the origin of the cell furnish drift sediment to this cell.  Northward net shore-drift is indicated by northward offset of the delta formed by the stream on a wave-cut platform, and increased beach width to the north.
