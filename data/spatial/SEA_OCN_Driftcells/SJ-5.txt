Friday Harbor quad

This cell is located in southern North Bay and has northward net shore-drift for 1.2 km.  Net shore-drift originates at glacial drift deposits overlying resistent rock directly west of Dinner Island. Northward net shore-drift is indicated by numerous accumulations of sediment on the south side of rock outcrops partially interrupting drift, and decreased sediment size to the north.  The terminus of the cell is located at a rock prominence northwest of the settlement of Argyle.
