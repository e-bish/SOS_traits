Friday Harbor, False Bay quads

No appreciable net shore-drift occurs along the shore of Griffin Bay from Argyle to Jensen Bay (False Bay quadrangle).  Two embayments are located within Griffin Bay, Merrifield Cove and Mulno Cove.  Pocket beaches occur within these coves and also in several smaller indentations in the coast along this predominantly rocky coastal sector.
