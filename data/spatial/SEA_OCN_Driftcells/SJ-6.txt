False Bay quad

This is a short drift cell extending from the northern to southern end of Jensen Bay.  Sediment is derived from glacial drift deposits that back the concave beach in this cell.  Large boulders are present in the nearshore area, indicating the erosional nature of this sector. Southeastward net shore-drift is indicated by accumulations of drift sediment on the northwest side of several rock outcrops located across the intertidal zone, southeastward beach width increase and sediment size decrease, and the eastward progradation of the shorter of two segments (approximately 100 m in length) of a double tombolo connecting Low Point to San Juan Island.  Low Point is the terminus of this cell.
