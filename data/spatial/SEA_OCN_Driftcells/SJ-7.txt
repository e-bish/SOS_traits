False Bay, Richardson quads

This relatively long drift cell (approximately 4.2 km) is found along the shore of southern Griffin Bay.  It originates at a headland composed of glacial drift located north of Mt. Finlayson (Mt. Finlayson is within San Juan National Historic Park, Richardson quadrangle).  The headland is erosional, providing sand and gravel drift sediment.  A mostly unvegetated bluff face fronted by an armored beach with abundant glacial erratics in the nearshore zone, consisting of boulders up to 3 m in diameter, reveals the erosional nature of the headland.  Northwestward net shore-drift is evidenced by an increase in the amount of bluff vegetation to the northwest, a spit that has prograded northwestward near the beginning of the drift cell, northwestward delta offset at the distal end of the spit, sediment accumulations on the southeast side of rocks partially interrupting drift, local northward increases in beach width between rocks partially interrupting drift, northward progradation of a tombolo to Low Point (False Bay quadrangle), and northward offset of a stream caused by progradation of the tombolo. Low Point is the terminus of this cell.  Generally northward net shore-drift in this coastal sector matches with northward net shore-drift on Lopez Island, on the opposite side of San Juan Channel.
