Richardson quad

This cell is found in southern Griffin Bay.  Net shore-drift originates at an erosional headland that is a zone of drift divergence in common with a cell to the west.  Net shore-drift is eastward for 0.6 km.  Indicators of eastward net shore-drift are an increase in the amount of bluff vegetation to the east, eastward increase in beach width and decrease in sediment size, eastward progradation of a spit half way across the front of a marsh, and sediment accumulation on the west side of a rock point at the terminus of the cell.
