Richardson quad

No appreciable net shore-drift occurs within the Fish Creek embayment and clockwise around the rocky headland south of Harbor Rock, to the terminus of a small cell near Goose Island.  The southern part of this sector faces San Juan Channel where water depth drops off abruptly and some of the fastest tidal currents in the archipelago are found.
