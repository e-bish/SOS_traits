Richardson quad

This is a 0.6 km cell along San Juan Channel with northward net shore-drift.  The cell is located along an accretional beach between two rocky prominences, west of Goose Island.  Sandy glacial drift deposits, which are the source of drift sediment, occur alongshore overlying Lummi Formation sedimentary rock in this area.  Excluding the southern end of the beach, which is partially protected from southerly wind waves by a large rocky prominence, beach width increases and sediment size decreases to the north, indicating northward net shore-drift.  The entire beach is accumulated against the southern side of the northern rock prominence, also indicating northward net shore-drift.  The open fetch to the south down San Juan Channel and across the Strait of Juan de Fuca facilitates northward net shore-drift in this area.
