Stuart Island quad

This 0.5-km-long drift cell originates at an eroding, rocky prominence southeast of the settlement of Prevost.  Net shore-drift is to the northwest, depositing at a small beach that fronts a marsh inside of Charles Point.  Net shore-drift indicators are sediment fining and an increase in beach width to the northwest, along with the erosional nature of the shore at the cell's origin and the accreting nature of the shore at the terminus.

Satellite Island is in the center of Prevost harbor, blocking virtually all open water wind waves from entering the harbor.  The resulting low energy waves present inside Prevost Harbor have little erosive power and minimal sediment volumes are transported by net shore-drift.
