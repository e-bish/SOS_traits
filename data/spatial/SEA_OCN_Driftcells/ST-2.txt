Stuart Island quad

This extremely short drift cell originates from an erosional rocky prominence just northwest of the Reid Harbor State Park dock.  Net shore-drift is to the northwest for 400 m, depositing at a small beach at the base of the rocky prominence that constitutes the sediment source of the adjacent cell to the west.  Indicators of net shore-drift include a decrease in sediment size and increase in beach width to the northwest.

Satellite Island is in the center of Prevost harbor, blocking virtually all open water wind waves from entering the harbor.  The resulting low energy waves present inside Prevost Harbor have little erosive power and minimal sediment volumes are transported by net shore-drift.
