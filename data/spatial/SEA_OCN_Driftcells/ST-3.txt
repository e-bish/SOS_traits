Stuart Island quad

This cell originates near the eastern end of Prevost Harbor at a small, erosional prominence directly in the path of incoming waves from the eastern approach to the harbor.  Net shore-drift is to the west for 1 km until material is deposited near the base of the State Park dock. Net shore-drift indicators in this cell are a decrease in sediment size and increase in beach width to the west, and the presence of sediment accumulations on the east side of rocks partially interrupting drift.

Satellite Island is in the center of Prevost harbor, blocking virtually all open water wind waves from entering the harbor.  The resulting low energy waves present inside Prevost Harbor have little erosive power and minimal sediment volumes are transported by net shore-drift.
