Stuart Island quad

This 200 meter cell originates at the same prominence as the adjacent cell to the west, with drift to the east. Drift converges at a developing mud flat at the far southeastern corner of Prevost Harbor, which receives the majority of its sediment input from a stream flowing through unconsolidated sediment.  Indicators of net shore-drift include a decrease in sediment size and increase in beach width to the east.

Satellite Island is in the center of Prevost harbor, blocking virtually all open water wind waves from entering the harbor.  The resulting low energy waves present inside Prevost Harbor have little erosive power and minimal sediment volumes are transported by net shore-drift.
