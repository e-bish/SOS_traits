Stuart Island quad

This 300 meter cell originates inside the rocky point at the eastern entrance to Prevost Harbor.  Net shore-drift converges with the adjacent cell at a developing mud flat at the far southeastern corner of Prevost Harbor, which receives the majority of its sediment input from a stream flowing through unconsolidated sediment.  Indicators of net shore-drift include a decrease in sediment size and increase in beach width to the southeast. 

Satellite Island is in the center of Prevost harbor, blocking virtually all open water wind waves from entering the harbor.  The resulting low energy waves present inside Prevost Harbor have little erosive power and minimal sediment volumes are transported by net shore-drift.
