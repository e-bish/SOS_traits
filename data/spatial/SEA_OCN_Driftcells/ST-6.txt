Stuart Island quad

This 0.8-km-long cell originates at the southern entrance to Johns Pass, at an erosional rocky cliff immediately north of the narrowest portion of the pass.  Net shore-drift is to the north, depositing on a concave beach with increasing beach width and decreasing sediment size to the north, grading from mixed gravel to sand.  Additional evidence is provided by the tombolo that apparently prograded as a spit from this beach towards the east, connecting a small island at the northern entrance of Johns Pass to Stuart Island.
