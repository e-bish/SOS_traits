Stuart Island quad

This is the northernmost of a pair of drift cells found near the head of Reid Harbor.  These cells contribute sediment to a pocket beach that fronts a marsh.  The majority of the length of the harbor sides consists of resistent rock that is devoid of beach sediment; net shore-drift occurs only within the last 1.0 km of the harbor.  Beach width increases and sediment size decreases in both cells approaching the pocket beach at the head of the harbor, indicating westward net shore-drift.
