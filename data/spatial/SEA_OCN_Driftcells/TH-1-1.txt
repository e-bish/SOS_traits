Nisqually quad

Beginning at a zone of divergence at Nisqually Head, this drift cell
develops south along the west shore of McAllister Creek.  This drift
direction is indicated by sediment prograded on the north side of the
boat ramp at Luhr Beach and nine groins, south of Luhr Beach, all with
sediment accumulations on the north side; as well as beach sediments
becoming finer to the south.  The drift cell terminus area is indicated
by a prograded beach composed of sand, and increased beach slope and
width.
