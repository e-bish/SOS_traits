Nisqually quad

This drift cell originates at a zone of divergence at Nisqually Head
and continues northwest to a terminus area located approximately on
the Willamette Meridian.  The direction of net shore-drift is indicated
by sediment fining to the northwest and sediment accumulation on the
southwest side of a groin.  The drift cell terminates at the southeast
end of an oyster farm which has been built across the upper foreshore.
