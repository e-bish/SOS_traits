Olympia quad

This drift cell originates 150 m north of Green Cove, and
terminates at the Cooper Point spit.  Evidence of a
northerly drift direction include prograded beaches on the south side of
obstructions to drift such as bulkheads, drain culverts and groins;
recurring patterns of sediment decreasing in size to the north; spits 
developed to the north across the mouths of small coves; and
beach widening to the north.
