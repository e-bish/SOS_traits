Olympia quad

This drift cell originates at a zone of divergence 300 m southeast of
Frye Cove and runs southeasterly to a terminus at Flapjack Point.  This
drift direction is evidenced by a decrease in bluff slope and an
increase in bluff vegetation, sediment fining to the southeast and a
spit developed to the southeast at Flapjack Point.
