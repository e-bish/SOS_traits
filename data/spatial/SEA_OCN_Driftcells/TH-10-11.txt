Olympia quad

Beginning at a zone of divergence 200 m west of Flapjack Point, this drift
cell runs west to a terminus area along the south shore of Frye
Cove.  Net shore-drift to the west is indicated by spits developed to
the west across the mouths of coves, sediment fining, and a reduction
of bluff slope to the west.  Net shore-drift terminates at a prograded
beach on the south shore of Frye Cove.
