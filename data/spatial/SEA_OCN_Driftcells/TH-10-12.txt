Olympia quad

This drift cell begins in a broad zone of divergence approximately 300
m north of Frye Cove (in the northwest quarter of Section 20)
and continues south to a terminus area in Frye Cove.  The southerly
net shore-drift is indicated by sediment prograded on the north side of
a drift log and the broad prograded beach developed to the south from
the north side of Frye Cove.
