Olympia quad

This drift cell begins at a divergent zone 200 m north of Green Cove
and runs southeast to a terminus along the north shore of Green Cove.
Net shore-drift is directed southeast as indicated by sediment fining,
beach width increase, and bluff slope becoming less steep and more
vegetated into Green Cove.  Net shore-drift terminates at a spit
developed to the southeast into Green Cove.
