Olympia quad

This drift cell begins at an area on the east shore of Snyder Cove, and
continued northeasterly to a terminus area along the southern shore of
Green Cove.  Net shore-drift to the northeast is indicated by repeated
patterns of sediment fining and beach widening to the northeast,
accumulations of sediment on the south sides of bulkheads, and the
northerly development of spits across stream mouths.  In several cases,
the spits divert the small streams to the north.
