Olympia quad

This drift cell originates in a broad zone of divergence in the
southwest quarter of Section 31 and continues north and west to a
terminus area 800 m south of Young Cove.  The direction of net
shore-drift is indicated by sediment accumulated on the south sides of
drift logs and groins, and slight beach widening.  The drift cell
terminates gradually along the south shore of the small cove.
