This very short drift cell is a reversal in drift direction to the
generally northerly transport of sediment.  Sediment is transported
south into a cove approximately 800 m south of Young Cove as evidenced
by sediment fining and beach widening to the south.  The terminus is a
prograded beach composed of sand and is of greater volume than the
beach on the south side of the cove.  The origin of the drift cell is a
narrow divergent zone approximately 60 m north of the terminus area.
