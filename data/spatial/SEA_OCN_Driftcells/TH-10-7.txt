Olympia quad

Beginning at a divergent zone approximately 500 m south of Young Cove
sediment is transported north to a spit developed into Young Cove.
Sediment is transported north as evidenced by sediment fining to the
north and accumulation of sediment on the south sides of groins and
bulkheads, as well as by the growth of the spit north into Young Cove.
