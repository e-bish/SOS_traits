Olympia quad

This drift cell originates at a divergent zone 400 m east of Young Cove
and continues east and north as evidenced by accumulations of sediment
on the southwest sides of groins and drift logs, reduction in bluff
slope, and sediment size decreasing to the northeast.  Sediment drift
termi-nates at a spit developed on the south side of Flapjack Point.
