This drift cell originates in an area north of White Point and
continues northeast as evidenced by accumulations of sediment on the
south sides of drift logs, bulkheads and groins, and identifiable,
traceable sediment in the form of oyster shells which came from the
oyster farm on White Point. Several spits, built north across the
mouths of small coves, were noted as additional evidence for a
northerly drift direction.  Sediment transport apparently terminates
at a prograded beach developed along the west shore of Snyder Cove.


NOTE: A house and accompanying cement bulkhead built out onto a 
beach protrusion in this cell, and an oyster farm facility developed 
just south at White Point, may have altered the original pattern of 
net shore drift that prevailed in this area prior to modern 
human occupation of this coast.
