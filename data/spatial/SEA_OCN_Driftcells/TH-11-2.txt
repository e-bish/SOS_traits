Olympia quad

This drift cell begins in the southwest quarter of Section 1 and
continues northeast to a terminus area on the north side of Shell
Point.  Evidence for the transport of sediment to the northeast rests
mainly on ill-defined sediment fining to the northeast around Shell
Point.  Shell Point is a prograded beach form with a storm berm built
on the southwest and northern flanks.  The berm decreases in height in
a clock-wise direction around the point, which suggests sediment is
transported to the northeast. In addition, a small prograded beach is
present on the south side of Simmons Creek which presumably is the
terminus area.  Sediment does not con-tinue north because the oyster
farm between Shell Point and White Point pro-hibits shore-drift.

NOTE: A house and accompanying cement bulkhead built out onto a beach 
protrusion (in the cell immediately north of this cell), and an oyster 
farm facility developed at White Point in this drift cell, may have 
altered the original pattern of net shore drift that prevailed in 
this area prior to modern human occupation of this coast.
