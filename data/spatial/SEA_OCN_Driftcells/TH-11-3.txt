Summit Lake quad

Beginning at an area 200 m south of Rocky Point this drift cell runs in
a northeasterly direction along the north-west shore of Eld Inlet,
terminating at Kay Point.  Net shore-drift to the northeast is
indicated by recurring patterns of sediment fining and beach widening
to the northeast, accumulations of sediment against the southwest sides
of beach logs and groins, and spit development to the north.  Sediment
drift terminates at Kay Point, which is a cuspate spit.
