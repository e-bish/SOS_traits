Olympia quad

This drift cell originates in a broad divergent zone located in the
southwest quarter of Section 31, and runs southwest to a terminus at
Kay Point.  Evidence for the southwest transport of sediment rests
mainly on the fact that Kay Point is a cuspate spit which indicates
that material is transported southwest to Kay Point.  The presence of
grasses and mussels on the north flanks of Kay Point indicate low wave
energy and minimal sediment transport from the north. Most of the
sediment brought to Kay Point probably comes from the south.
