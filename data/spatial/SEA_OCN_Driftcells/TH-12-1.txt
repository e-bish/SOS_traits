Squaxin Island, Summit Lake, Shelton quads
  
Beginning in a divergent zone in the northwest quarter
of Section 26, shore-drift is directed north-eastward as evidenced by
sediment accumulated on the southwest sides of drift obstructions such
as fallen logs and bulkheads; repeated patterns of sediment fining;
beach widening to the north; and spits developed to the northeast
across small stream mouths.  One such spit has diverted a stream
approximately 280 m to the north-east. Sediment drift terminates at 
the center of Section 13 at a 45 m long spit which is built north into 
a cove.
