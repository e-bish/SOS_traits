Summit Lake quad

This drift cell originates along a divergent zone in the northwest
quarter of Section 26 and develops westward to a terminus area in Burns
Cove.  This drift direction is evidenced by sediment prograded on the
northeast sides of obstructions to drift such as bulkheads, groins and
logs, and sediment fining and spit development to the west.  Several
streams are diverted to the west by spits.  Sediment drift terminates
at a 10 m long spit on the east shore of Burns Cove.
