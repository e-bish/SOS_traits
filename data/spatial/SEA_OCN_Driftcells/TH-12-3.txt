Summit Lake quad

This drift cell originates in the southwest quarter of Section 28 and
runs east and south, terminating in Burns Cove.  Drift to the east is
indicated by beach widening and spit development to the east.  Most of
the spits divert small streams to the east.  Sediment is directed
around Burns Point, and then south into Burns Cove as indicated by
bluff slope reduction and sediment fining to the south.  Net
shore-drift terminates at a spit built on the northwest side of Burns
Cove.
