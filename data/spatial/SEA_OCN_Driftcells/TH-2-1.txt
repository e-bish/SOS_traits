Nisqually quad

This drift cell originates on the north side of an oyster farm.
Sediment is eroding from near-vertical bluffs and is transported west
as shown by sediment fining, and bluffs become more vegetated and less
steep to the west.  Sediment terminates at a 45 m long spit developed
to the west, partially across the mouth of a small cove.
