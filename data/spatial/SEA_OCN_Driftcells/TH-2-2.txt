Nisqually, Lacey quads

This drift cell originates at a divergent zone in the northeast
quarter of Section 23 and runs southeast to a terminus area in Hogum
Bay.  Evidence for the transport of sediment to the southeast is a spit
developed to the south across the mouth of Butterball Cove which also
diverts the stream to the south approximately 75 m.  Additional
indicators of the southeast transport of sediment are several groins
with sediment accumulated on their northwest sides.  The drift cell
terminates at a 60 m long spit which is developed to the southeast,
partially across the mouth of a small cove.
