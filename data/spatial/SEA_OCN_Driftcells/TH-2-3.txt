Lacey quad

The drift Cell originates in a zone of divergence in the northeast
quarter of Section 23.  Sediment is transported west into Big Slough as
evidenced by sediment fining to the west and sediment accumulated on
the east side of nine groins.  Sediment terminates at a 150 m long spit
developed northeast into Big Slough.  The spit is composed of 1.0 cm to
2.5 cm pebbles over sand.  The coarser material was added to the spit
at Tolmie State Park to stabilize it for recreational use.
