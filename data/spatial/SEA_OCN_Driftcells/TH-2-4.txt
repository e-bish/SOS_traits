Lacey quad

Beginning at a zone of divergence at Sandy Point, this drift cell
continues southeast to a terminus area in Big Slough.  The direction
of net shore-drift is indicated by sediment fining into Big Slough and
a groin series with sediment accumulated on the north side of each
groin.  The terminus area is a spit, composed of sand, developed south
into Big Slough.
