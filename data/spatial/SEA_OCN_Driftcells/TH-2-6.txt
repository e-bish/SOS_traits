Longbranch quad

This drift cell originates at a zone of divergence along the Nisqually
Reach approximately 1.6 km north of Dogfish Bight.  Sediment is
transported south to a terminus in Dogfish Bight, as evidenced by
several obstructions to drift with sediment accumulated on the north
side, sediment size fining to the south, and increased beach width to
the south.  The terminus area in Dogfish Bight is a prograding beach
composed predominantly of sand.
