Longbranch quad

This drift cell begins in a zone of divergence approximately 1.2
kilometers south of Mill Bight and runs north and west to a terminus
area on the south side of Mill Bight.  The direction of net shore-drift
is indicated by bluffs becoming more vegetated and less steep into
Mill Bight, accumulations of sediment on the south side of several
boat ramps and groins, and a spit developed to the north across a small
cove located approximately 300 m north of the divergent zone.  Net
shore-drift terminates at a 75 m long spit developed into Mill Bight.
