Longbranch quad

This short drift cell originates in a divergent zone approximately
300 m north of Mill Bight and Proceeds south to a terminus area in Mill
Bight.  Evidence for sediment transport to the south are beach
widening, and sediment fining to the south.  Net shore-drift
terminates at a 125 m long spit composed of sand, extending into Mill
Bight.
