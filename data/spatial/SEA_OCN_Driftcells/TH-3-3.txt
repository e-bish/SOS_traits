Longbranch quad

Beginning in a divergent zone approximately 300 m north of Mill Bight, this
drift cell continues northwesterly to a terminus on the south side
of Baird Cove. This drift direction is indicated by two spits which
have developed to the north across two small coves.  Both spits divert
streams to the north.  Net shore-drift terminates at a 150 m long spit
developed to the southwest into Baird Cove.
