Longbranch quad

This short cell begins in a divergent zone approximately 150 m south of
Poncin Cove and runs southeast to a terminus area at a marina
facility.  Evidence for this is an accumulation of sand on the north
side of the marina facility.  Before the marina was built a spit
developed to the south into Baird Cove, the tip of which is still
present (in its natural state) in the cove.  Although the spit is no
longer the modern terminus, its presence in the cove does support the
southerly direction of net shore-drift.
