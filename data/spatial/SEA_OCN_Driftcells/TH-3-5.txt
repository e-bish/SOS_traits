Longbranch quad

This drift cell originates in a divergent zone approximately 150 m
south of Poncin Cove along a northerly stretch of the Nisqually Reach
and runs north to a terminus at Johnson Point.  This drift direction is
indicated by a spit developed to the north from the south end of
Poncin Cove, sediment fining to the north, and beach widening and
increasing in volume to the north.  The terminus area is at a cuspate
spit developed at Johnson Point.
