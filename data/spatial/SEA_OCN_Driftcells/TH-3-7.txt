Longbranch quad

This drift Cell begins in an ill-defined origin area approximately 300
m north of the Weyerhauser railroad logging facility and runs north and
east to a terminus at Cliff Point.  Evidence for northeasterly
transport of sediment rests mainly on the cuspate spit developed at
Cliff Point and on beach widening to the northeast.  The cuspate spit
is composed of mixed sand and pebbles.
