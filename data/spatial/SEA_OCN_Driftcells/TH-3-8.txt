Longbranch quad

From a divergent zone at the headland near the end of East Libby Road,
sediment is transported south, along the west shore of Henderson
Inlet.  This drift direction is indicated by fining of sediment to the
south and prograding beach sediment on the north sides of bulkheads and
other obstructions to drift.  Drift terminates at a cuspate spit called
Cliff Point.
