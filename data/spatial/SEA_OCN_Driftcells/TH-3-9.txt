Longbranch quad

This drift cell begins at a divergent zone near the end of East Libby
Road and runs southwest to a terminus area in an unnamed cove.
Evidence for drift to the southwest includes beach widening and
sediments, fining to the southwest, and several groins have
accumulations of material on their northeast sides.  In the terminus
area a small spit is developed to the southwest, partially across the
mouth of a stream.
