Longbranch quad

The drift cell begins at a zone of divergence in the northeast quarter of
Section 17.  The northerly drift direction is indicated by accumulations 
of sediment on the south sides of numerous obstructions to drift, such 
as bulkheads, groins, boat ramps, and fallen timber.  Additional indicators 
of a northerly transport of sediment are recurring patterns of sediment 
fining, beach widening, and bluff slope reduction to the north.  
The terminus of the drift cell is a cuspate spit at Johnson Point.
