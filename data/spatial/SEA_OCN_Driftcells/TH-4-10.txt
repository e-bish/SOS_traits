Longbranch quad

Most of the southwestern and southern shore of Henderson Inlet 
has no appreciable net shore drift. The banks of these areas are 
composed of silt and clay with some sand. The fine sediment, combined
with low wave energy in this area, results in very little, if any, net
shore-drift. What slight movement there is of sand is apparently to 
the south, as evidenced by slight accumulations on the north side of 
small protrusions of land into Henderson Inlet.
