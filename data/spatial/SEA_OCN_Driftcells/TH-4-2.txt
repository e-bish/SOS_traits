Longbranch quad

This drift cell originates in a zone of divergence in the northeast
quarter of Section 17 and runs south to a spit developed across the
mouth of a small embayment.  The main indicators of southerly net
shore-drift are a 60 m long spit developed to the south from the north
side of a small embayment and the stream offset to the south by the
spit.
