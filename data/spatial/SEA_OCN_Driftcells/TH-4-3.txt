Longbranch quad

From a divergent zone at a headland in the southeast quarter of Section
17, sediment is transported north along the east shore of Henderson
Inlet.  This drift direction is indicated by a decrease in sediment
size to the north, a groin series with sediment prograded on the south
sides, and a spit developed to the north partially across the mouth of
a small embayment.  The net shore-drift terminates at the spit.
