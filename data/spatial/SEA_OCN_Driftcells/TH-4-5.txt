Longbranch quad

This drift cell is a very short, isolated drift cell, within an
embayment on the east shore of Henderson Inlet.  From a divergent zone
in the northeast quarter of Section 20, net shore-drift is to the north
as indicated by a small spit of sand and pebbles developed to the
north which diverts a small stream to the north.  Once sediment is
within the embayment material continues north as indicated by another
spit of sand and silt developed to the north, which also diverts a very
small stream to the north.
