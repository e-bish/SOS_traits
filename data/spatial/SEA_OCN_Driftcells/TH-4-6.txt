Lacey quad

This drift cell begins at a divergent zone in the northeast quarter of
Section 20 and continues south along the east shore of the narrowing
Henderson Inlet.  This drift direction is indicated by sediment
accumulated on the north side of logs across the upper foreshore and a
prograded beach which exhibits a sediment size decrease to the south.
The terminus region is a very diffuse accumulation area of sand, silt
and clay.
