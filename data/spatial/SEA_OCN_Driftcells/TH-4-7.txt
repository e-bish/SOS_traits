Longbranch quad

This drift Cell is located on the south shore of a peninsula which
separates Chapman Bay to the north and Woodard Bay to the south.
Beginning in a broad divergent zone along the south shore of the
peninsula, this very short drift cell runs west and terminates against
a rampart leading to a railroad bridge.  This drift direction is
evidenced by an accumulation of sand and silt on the east side of the
bridge rampart.  There is no apparent net shore-drift in Woodard Bay.
