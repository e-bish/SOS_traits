Longbranch quad

Beginning at a zone of divergence on the south shore of a peninsula in
Henderson Inlet, this drift cell continues to the east to a terminus
area on the southeast tip of the peninsula.  This drift direction is
indicated by beach widening to the east and the progradation of sand
at the southeast tip of the peninsula.
