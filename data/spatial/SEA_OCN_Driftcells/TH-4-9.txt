Longbranch quad

This drift cell originates on the north shore of a peninsula which
separates Chapman Bay to the north and Woodard Bay to the south and 
runs east and south to a terminus on the southeast tip of the peninsula.  
This drift direction is indicated by a decrease in sediment size to 
the southeast and the presence of a prograded sand beach on the 
southeast tip of the peninsula.  There is no apparent net shore-drift 
in Chapman Bay or north of Chapman Bay along the west shore of 
Henderson Inlet until the drift cell that terminates at Cliff point.
