Longbranch quad

Beginning in a zone of divergence 400 m
northeast of Big Fishtrap, net shore-drift is directed to the east as
evidenced by sediment accumulated on the south and west sides of
numerous obstructions to drift, such as groins, bulkheads and drift
logs, and sediment fining and beaching widening to the northeast.
Sediment is transported to the east around Dickenson Point. 
Net shore-drift to the southeast is indicated by a decrease 
in sediment size and reduction in bluff steepness to the
southeast.  An additional indicator is the presence of oblique sand
bars in the cove which lie on the low-tide beach and trend in a
south-easterly direction. The drift cell terminates at a spit
developed partially across the mouth of a small stream, in an 
unnamed cove just east of Dickenson Point.
