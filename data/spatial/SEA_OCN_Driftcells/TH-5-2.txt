Longbranch quad

This short drift cell begins in a divergent zone approximately 400 m
north of Big Fishtrap and runs south into Big Fishtrap.  Southerly net
shore-drift is indicated by sediment fining and beach widening to the
south, and at the terminus of the drift cell, a 60 m long spit
developed to the south from the east side of Big Fishtrap.
