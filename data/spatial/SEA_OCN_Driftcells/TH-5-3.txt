Longbranch, Squaxin Island quads

This drift cell originates in a zone of divergence approximately 400 m
northeast of Zangle Cove and runs northeast to a terminus area along
the western shore of Big Fishtrap.  Evidence for the transport of
sediment to the northeast is a decrease in sediment size to the
northeast, accumulations of sediment on the southwest sides of drift
obstructions, and a spit developed to the northeast partially across
the mouth of Little Fish-trap. Sediment drift terminates at a spit,
composed of sand, developed to the south into Big Fishtrap.
