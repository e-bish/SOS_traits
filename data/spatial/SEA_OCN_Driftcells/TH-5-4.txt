Squaxin Island quad

This drift cell begins in a zone of divergence approximately 400 m
northeast of Zangle Cove and continues west and south to a terminus on
the east shore of Zangle Cove.  The direction of net shore-drift is
indicated by sediment accumulated on the northeast side of drift
obstructions and sediment fining to the southwest.  A spit is
developed on the east side of Zangle Cove, which is the terminus area
for this drift cell.
