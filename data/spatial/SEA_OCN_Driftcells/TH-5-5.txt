Squaxin Island quad

Beginning at a divergent zone 400 m west of Dover Point, net
shore-drift is directed northeast, and then southeast to a terminus
area on the west shore of Zangle Cove.  Sediment is transported into
Zangle Cove as evidenced by sediment size decreasing and beach widening
to Zangle Cove, and accumulation of sediment on the west side of groins
and bulkheads.  The drift cell terminates at a spit developed into
Zangle Cove.
