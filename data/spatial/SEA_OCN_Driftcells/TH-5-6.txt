Squaxin Island quad

This short drift cell begins at a divergent zone 400 m west of Dover
Point and continues east and south to a terminus area in the cove near
Boston Harbor. Evidence for the transport of sediment to the southeast
is a decrease in sediment size south into the cove, and prograded
beaches on the north side of a groin and a bulkhead.
