Squaxin Island, Olympia quads

This drift cell begins in a zone of divergence approximately
100 m north of Gull Harbor. The northerly drift direction is
indicated by a spit developed to the north across the mouth of a cove,
diversion of the stream to the north by the spit, and the fining of
sediment and increased beach width to the north.  The terminus area
approximately 400 m east of Dofflemyer Point is a prograding beach
composed predominantly of sand.
