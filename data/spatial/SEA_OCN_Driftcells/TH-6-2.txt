Olympia quad

This short drift cell originates in a divergent zone about 100 m north
of Gull Harbor and runs east to a terminus area in Gull Harbor.  The
direction of net shore-drift is indicated by sediment fining to the
east and the development of a 22 m long spit developed to the east
along the north shore of Gull Harbor.
