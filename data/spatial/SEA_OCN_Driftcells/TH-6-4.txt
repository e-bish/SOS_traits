Segment 6-4 begins at a zone of divergence approximately 400 m north of
Butler Cove and continues north to include Segment 8-1.  Sediment from
the drift cell terminates at Cooper Point (See Map TH-8, Segment 8-1)

Net shore-drift to the north is indicated by repeated patterns of
sediment fining to the north, sediment accumu-lated on the south side
of numerous groins and bulk-heads, and consistent sectors of beach
widening to the north.  An additional indicator of northerly netshore
drift is the presence of a pro-graded beach on the south side of
an intertidal delta found in Little Tykle Cove.
