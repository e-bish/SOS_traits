Olympia quad

This segment originates at a zone of divergence at Priest Point.  Drift
is directed to the north as evidenced by a decrease in
sediment size to the north and accumulation of sediment on the south side of
drift logs, boat ramps and bulkheads.  Sediment transported along this drift cell
terminates at a 180 m long spit built to the north from the
south side of Gull Harbor.
