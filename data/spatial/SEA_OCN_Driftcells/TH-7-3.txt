Olympia quad

Beginning at a zone of divergence approximately 800 m south of Ellis
Cove, sediment is transported to the north as indicated by sediment
prograded on the south side of bulkhead steps and on the south side of
a small stream.  Here the stream is acting like a drift obstruction,
inhibiting sediment from being transported along the coast.  Additional
indicators of a northerly net shore-drift are beach widening and
sediment fining to the north and a 40 m long spit developed north into
Ellis Cove.
