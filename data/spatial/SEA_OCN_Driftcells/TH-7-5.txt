Olympia quad

This drift cell originates in a divergent zone approximately 400 m east
of Butler Cove and continues south-easterly to a terminus 400 m north
of the West Bay Marina.  This drift direction is indicated by sediment
decreasing in size to the southeast and sediment prograded on the north
side of groins and fallen trees across the upper foreshore.
