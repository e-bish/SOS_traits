Olympia quad

Beginning in a divergent zone approximately 400 m east of Butler Cove,
this drift cell continues west and south into Butler Cove.  This drift
direction is indicated by increased beach width and slope to the west,
and a decrease in bluff slope and an increase in bluff vegetation into
Butler Cove.  Sediment terminates at a prograded beach on the east
shore of Butler Cove.
