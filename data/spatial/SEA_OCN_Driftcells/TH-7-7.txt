Olympia quad

This drift cell begins at a divergent zone 400 m north of Butler Cove
and runs to the south into the west shore of Butler Cove where drift
terminates.  The direction of net shore-drift is indicated by the
accumulation of sediment on the north side of concrete stairs attached
to a bulkhead and the prograded beach on the west shore of Butler
Cove.
