Olympia, Squaxin Island quads

This drift cell originates in a zone of divergence 400 m north of Butler Cove.  
Net shore-drift to the north is indicated by repeated patterns of
sediment fining to the north, sediment accumulated on the south side
of numerous groins and bulkheads, and consistent sectors of beach
widening to the north.  An additional indicator of northerly netshore
drift is the presence of a prograded beach on the south side of
an intertidal delta found in Little Tykle Cove.

In the northern portion of this cell, shore-drift is evidenced by
spit development to the north across a small cove 1.6 km southeast of
Cooper Point.  This spit (called Silver Spit on the 15' quadrangle) is
45 m long and diverts the stream north by the same amount.
Net shore-drift terminates at Cooper Point which is a spit.  There is
severe bluff erosion dangerously close to the most northerly house
along the northeast shore of Cooper Point.
