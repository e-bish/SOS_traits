Beginning at a zone of
divergence in the northeast quarter of Section 8 (see Map TH-9, Segment
9-2), sediment is transported to the north to a terminus area southwest
of Steamboat Island.  Net shore-drift is trans-ported north as
evidenced by the decrease in bluff slope to the north, and sediment
accumulated on the south side of obstructions to drift such as beach
logs, a boat ramp, and groins.  Sediment terminates at a long spit
developed to the northwest, in itself a decisive indicator of the net
drift direction.
