Olympia, Squaxin Island quads

The origin of this drift cell is a broad zone of divergence 
approximately 800 m north of Frye Cove where landsliding has been, 
and is presently, occurring. Northerly net shore-drift is indicated 
by slight stream diversions to the north; sediment accumulated 
on the south sides of drift obstructions such as drift logs and groins; 
sediment fining and bluff slope reduction to the north; and sediment 
accumulated on the south side of a groin and bulkhead.   The terminus 
area of this drift cell is a spit which has developed to the north 
into Sanderson Harbor.
