Squaxin Island quad

This short drift cell originates in a zone of divergence 300 m east of
Sanderson Harbor and runs west into Sanderson Harbor.  Evidence for the
westerly transport of sediment are sediments decreasing in size to the
west and the development of a 10 m spit northwest into Sanderson
Harbor.
