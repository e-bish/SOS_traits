Squaxin Island quad

Beginning at a divergent zone 300 m east of Sanderson Harbor, this drift
cell runs north to Hunter Point and then west to a small cove 800 m
southeast of Sandy Point.  Sediment is transported to the north as
evidenced by sediment fining, bluff slope reduction, and beach width
and slope increas-ing toward Hunter Point.  Additional indicators are
groins with sediment built up on their south sides, and a prograded
beach at Hunter Point.  The majority of material transported to this
area is deposited at Hunter Point, however some sediment continues west
as evidenced by prograded beach sediment on the east side of a
bulkhead, drift logs and a boat ramp.  The terminus area is a
prograded beach on the east side of the cove.
