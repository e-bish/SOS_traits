Squaxin Island quad

This short drift cell is a small reversal in drift direction to the
generally westerly transport of sediment.  Sediment is transported to
the southeast into a small cove approximately 800 m southeast of Sandy
Point as evidenced by sediment accumulated on the northwest side of a
fallen tree and a prograded beach on the west side of the cove.  An
ill-defined divergent zone is present approximately 200 m northwest of
the cove.
