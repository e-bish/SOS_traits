Squaxin Island quad

This drift cell begins at an ill-defined divergent zone approximately
600 m southeast of Sandy Point and runs northwest to a terminus area on
the east flank of Sandy Point.  Sediment is transported to the
northwest as indicated by sediment accumulated on the east side of
bulkheads and the increase of beach width to the west.
