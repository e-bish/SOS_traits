Squaxin Island quad

This drift cell originates in a divergent zone at the northern tip of
Steamboat Island.  Sediment is transported south to a terminus area on
the southeast flank of Steamboat Island as indicated by sediment
accumulated on the north side of a boat ramp and a decrease in bluff
steepness and overall dimensions to the south.  Severe bluff erosion is
occur-ring at the northern end of Steamboat Island which poses a
threat to homes built on top of the bluff.
