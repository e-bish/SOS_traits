Squaxin Island quad

This drift cell originates in a zone of divergence at the northern tip
of Steamboat Island.  Net shore-drift to the south is indicated by a
decrease in bluff steepness and overall dimension to the south and
sediment accumulated on the north sides of small groins.  The terminus
area lies in the on the southwest side of Steamboat Island where sand
has accumulated in the lee of a large spit developed from the south.
