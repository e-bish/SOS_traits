Shelton quad

This drift cell begins at a divergence zone 200 m west of
a cove that lies in the center of Section 13 and runs northward to a
prograded beach at Dogfish Point.  The northerly net shore-drift is
indicated by a decrease in bluff slope and an increase in bluff
vegetation, decreases in sediment size, and increase in beach width
and volume to the north, as well as sediment accumulated on the south
side of drift logs.
