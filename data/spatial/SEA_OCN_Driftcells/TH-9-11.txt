Squaxin Island quad

This drift cell begins at a divergence zone
approximately 200 m west of a cove that lies in the center of Section
13 and continues east to a spit where sediment transport terminates.
Shore-drift is directed to the east, as evidenced by sediment fining
and beach widening to the east, and a stream diverted to the east by
the spit.
