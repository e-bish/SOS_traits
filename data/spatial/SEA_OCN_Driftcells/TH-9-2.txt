Squaxin Island quad

Beginning at a zone of divergence in the northwest quarter of Section 8,
sediment is transported to the north as evidenced by a 60 m spit
developed north across the mouth of a cove, sediment size decrease to
the north, and sediment accumulated on the south side of obstructions 
to drift such as beach logs, a boat ramp, stairs and groins. 
Transport from this segment terminates at a spit west of Steamboat Island, 
in itself a decisive indicator of the net drift direction.
