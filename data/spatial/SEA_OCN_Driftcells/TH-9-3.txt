Squaxin Island quad

This drift cell begins at a zone of divergence in the north-west
quarter of Section 8 and continues southeasterly to a spit where
sediment transport terminates.  Net shore-drift is directed to the
southeast as indicated by sediment fining and the develop-ment of the
spit built southeast into the cove.
