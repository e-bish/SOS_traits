Squaxin Island quad

This drift cell originates at a divergent zone in the southwest
quarter of Section 8 and runs north to a terminus area in a cove in the
northwest quarter of Section 8.  Net shore-drift to the north is
evidenced by sediment accumulated on the south side of a boat ramp,
sediment fining to the north, and the development of a spit to the
north, partially across the mouth of a cove.
