Squaxin Island quad

This short drift cell begins at a divergent zone in the southwest
quarter of Section 8 and continues south to a terminus area along the
north side of a small cove approximately 1.1 km north of Gallagher
Cove. Sediment is transported south as evidenced by a 60 m spit
developed south into the cove, and sediment fining to the south.
