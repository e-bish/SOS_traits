Squaxin Island quad

This short drift cell originates at a zone of divergence approximately
1 km north of Gallagher Cove and continues southeast.  Net shore-drift
is directed northeast, then southeast, as evidenced by a spit
developed to the southeast, and sediment fining in a clockwise
direction into the cove.
