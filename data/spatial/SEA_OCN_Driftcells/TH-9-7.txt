Squaxin Island quad

Beginning at a zone of divergence in the southeast quarter of Section
7, this drift cell continues southwesterly into Gallagher Cove.  Net
shore-drift to the south is indicated by sediment prograded on the
north sides of drift logs, spits developed to the south across the
mouth of coves, the offset of small streams to the south by spits, and
sediment size decreasing to the south.  Drift terminates in a broad
intertidal mudflat, at the southwest end of Gallagher Cove.
