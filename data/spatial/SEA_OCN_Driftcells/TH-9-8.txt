Squaxin Island quad

This drift cell begins in a divergent zone approximately 1 km northwest
of Gallagher Cove and continues south into Gallagher Cove where drift
terminates in a broad intertidal mudflat.  The southerly net
shore-drift is indicated by a spit developed south into Gallagher Cove
and sediment accumulated on the north sides of drift logs.
