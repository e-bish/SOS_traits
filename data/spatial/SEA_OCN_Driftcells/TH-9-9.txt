Squaxin Island quad

This drift cell originates at a zone of divergence approximately 1 km
northwest of Gallagher Cove and continues southwest to a terminus at a
prograded beach that is locally called Dogfish Point.  Shore-drift is
directed southwesterly as evidenced by sediment fining to the west,
prograded beaches on the northeast side of small streams, and sediment
accumulated on the northeast sides of drift logs.
