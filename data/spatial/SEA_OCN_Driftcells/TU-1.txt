Shaw Island quad

This cell is found on the southern shore of Turn Island and has westward net shore-drift for 400 m.  Drift sediment is derived from small glacial drift deposits overlying resistent sedimentary rock.  The cell originates at the east end of a beach located approximately half way across the southern shore of the island.  Westward net shore-drift is indicated by local westward beach width increase and sediment size decrease, sediment accumulations on the east side of rocks partially interrupting drift, and the progradation of the beach at the cell's terminus, located at the southwest corner of the island, where drift sediment from this cell converges with drift sediment from the adjacent cell to the north.
