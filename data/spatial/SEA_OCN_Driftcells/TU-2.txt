Shaw Island quad

This cell is located on the northwest shore of Turn Island, with southwestward net shore-drift.  Net shore-drift originates at the beginning of a linear beach on the northwest side of the island and extends to near the westernmost corner of the island (depositing some sediment in a short spit).  Net shore-drift then continues along the shore of a small embayment at the southwest end of the island with the remaining portion of drift sediment, converging with the depositional end of the adjacent cell to the south. Evidence of generally southwestward net shore-drift is provided by increased beach width over the length of the cell, and progradation of the spit near the terminus of the cell.
