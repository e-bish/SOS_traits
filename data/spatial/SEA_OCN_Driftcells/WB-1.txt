Bay Center quad

This drift cell begins at a zone of divergence in front of Tokeland, extends to the northwest, and terminates about 1.0 km northwest of its origin near the tidal inlet on the southeast side of Graveyard Spit. Accumulation of sediment on the southeastern side of a wooden groin and a mixed-composition groin (boulders, concrete, pilings) indicate northwesterly transport. This accumulation has resulted in a vertical rise of the beach surface of about .3 m on the southeast and a horizontal offset landward of the shoreline of roughly 1.0 m on the northwest of the wooden groin. The mixed composition groin has a horizontal landward offset of the shoreline of about .6 m on the northwest and a vertical rise of the beach surface of approximately .3 m on the southeast. A slight increase in beach width to the northwest is also apparent. The terminus of this drift cell is located about 1.0 km to the northwest of Tokeland where the sand fades into a vegetated area of the tidal inlet. Sand-sized grains are found along the length of this drift cell. Transport within this cell is most likely due to a local fetch from the east.

Rip-rap protects the shore from about 100 m to the west of Tokeland to the northern side of the Tokeland marina, including the two Tokeland marina jetties. The structure is built along the backshore with several large rip-rap groins extending across the foreshore that impede, but do not totally block, sediment transport.
