Bay Center quad

Beginning at a zone of divergence in front of Tokeland, this drift cell extends to the east and terminates at the Tokeland marina. Fining of sediment to the east indicates easterly transport. Distinct angular cobbles are eroding from one segment of the bulkhead within this drift cell and are found several hundred feet to the east. Sand-sized grains, pebbles, and granules are found near the origin as well as the cobbles. The grain size near the terminus is mostly fine sand. The most apparent indicator of net shore-drift direction is the accumulation of sediment on the west side of the series of groins and corresponding erosion on the east side in this drift cell. This drift cell  wraps around the end of Toke Point, with drift continuing to the north. It terminates with sediment accumulation against the small Tokeland marina jetty which extends to the north. Open ocean fetch is the probable driving force behind this drift cell.
Rip-rap protects the shore from about 100 m to the west of Tokeland to the northern side of the Tokeland marina, including the two Tokeland marina jetties. The structure is built along the backshore with several large rip-rap groins extending across the foreshore that impede, but do not totally block, sediment transport.
