Bay Center, South Bend, Nemah quads

The northern corner of Willapa Bay from the western side of the Tokeland marina to Goose Point is an area of no appreciable net shore-drift as a result of prevalent near-shore vegetation. This area is characterized by lack of sand-sized sediment, nearshore vegetation, and extensive tidal flats.

Roughly 20 m of rip-rap protects Highway 105 directly to the southwest of the mouth of the Cedar River.
Rip-rap protects Highway 105 from slightly southeast of the mouth of the Cedar River to a short distance west of Freshwater Creek, a distance of nearly 4 km.
Approximately 2.5 km of rip-rap protects Highway 105 west of the North River.
Southeast of Smith Creek, the shore in front of Highway 105 is armored with roughly 1.8 km of rip-rap.
A rock groin extends for about 100 m across the tidal flats at Stony Point.
