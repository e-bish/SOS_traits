This drift cell originates at Goose Point, extends to the south, and terminates about 2 km south of Sandy Point. Grain size diminution to the south as well as sediment accumulation on the north side of several large, in-place stumps indicate southward transport. Coarse sand and a small amount of pebbles are found at the origin of the cell. Medium to fine sand prevails toward the terminus of this drift cell. Vertical offsets up to .4 m were observed on the north side of in-place stumps within this drift cell. Sediment transport at the cell origin is possibly influenced by ocean waves entering through the Willapa Bay inlet. However, essential transport for the entire cell likely remains under the influence of local fetch from the north.
South of Rhodesia Beach, a .8 km rip-rap bulkhead protects houses that are located on the upper foreshore. This bulkhead impedes sediment transport but does not entirely block it.
The upper shore along the road at Sandy Point has been reinforced with rip-rap for approximately 100 m. Also at this location, two rock groins are located on the tidal flats. They do not extend across the sandy stretch of shore and therefore do not indicate a drift direction.
