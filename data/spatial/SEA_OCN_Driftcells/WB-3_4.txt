Beginning roughly 2.0 km south of Sandy Point is an area of no appreciable net shore-drift that extends south across the mouth of the Naselle River, around the southern end of Willapa Bay and then northward to slightly north of Nahcotta. This zone is a result of well-vegetated shores, extensive tidal flats, and no sand-sized sediment available for transport.
Beginning at the southwestern end of the Stanley Peninsula, Highway 101 is protected intermittently by rip-rap. This structure extends for approximately 7 km to the southwest.
The Nahcotta marina is protected by a rip-rap jetty that extends to the east for approximately .5 km.
