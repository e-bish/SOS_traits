Oysterville quad

This short drift cell begins at the former site of the Willapa Camp. This site is commonly referred to as Yellow Bluffs by residents of the area. Sediment accumulating on. the north side of two rip-rap groins indicates southwesterly transport. This sediment is beginning to prograde to the southwest over the rip-rap. An approximately 7.5 m high, vegetated dune is being eroded immediately to the southwest of the end of an 80 m rip-rap bulkhead at this site.  This area has experienced severe erosion problems. Grain size diminution of particles eroding from the groins and bulkhead is evident to the south. The terminus of this drift cell is in the small bay to the southwest of the Willapa Camp where sediment is accumulating. Sand-sized sediment prevails in this area. A long local fetch from the north drives sediment transport within this cell.
