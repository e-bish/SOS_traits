Oysterville quad

Beginning at the northern end of the Willapa Camp, an area of no appreciable net shore-drift extends to slightly north of Stackpole Harbor. This situation occurs as a result of extensive near-shore vegetation and tidal flats.
Approximately 2 km of the shore in front of Oysterville is protected by rip-rap which has been overgrown by brush.
