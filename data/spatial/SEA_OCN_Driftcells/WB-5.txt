Oysterville quad

The origin of this drift cell is located slightly north of Stackpole Harbor. Eroding dunes, with a large accumulation of fallen trees across the beach, indicate the beginning of this drift cell. Accumulation on the southern side of several,of the larger trees indicates transport of sediment to the north. A northern increase in beach width also supports northward transport. The terminus of this drift cell is approximately 2.5 km to the north of Stackpole Harbor. Sediment transport in this cell is associated with a long local fetch from the south/southeast. A marshy, vegetated area located in front of the majority of this drift cell would seem to inhibit future transport of sediment in this area.
