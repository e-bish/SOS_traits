Long Island, Ocean Park quads

This drift cell begins slightly south of Smoky Hollow, extends generally to the northwest, and terminates at the end of Jensen Point. Vegetated bluffs averaging roughly 13 m high are eroding at the beginning and middle of this cell while Jensen Point, at the end, is a fairly flat, unvegetated spit. A reduction in grain size was observed from Smoky Hollow northwestward to Jensen Point. Pebbles and granules prevail in the southeastern end of this drift cell while the spit is characterized by fine sand. An increase in beach width from southeast to northwest is also apparent. Local fetch from the south drives sediment transport within this drift cell.
