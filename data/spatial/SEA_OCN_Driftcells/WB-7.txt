Long Island quad

This drift cell extends northward from slightly north of Jensen Point to Diamond Point. An increase in beach width to the north was observed. High, eroding bluffs extend along almost the entire length of this drift cell except at the terminus to the southwest of Diamond Point. The beach at the base of this eroding bluff tends to be very narrow. There is an accumulation of sand at the terminus. Some sediment is probably carried offshore into the vegetated tidal flats. Sediment transport in this drift cell is related to a local southerly fetch.
