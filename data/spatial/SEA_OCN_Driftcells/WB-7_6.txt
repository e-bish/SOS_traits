Long Island quad

The east side of Long Island from Diamond Point at the north end, to High Point at the south end, is an area of no appreciable net shore-drift. High Point is a rocky headland, one of the few locations where bedrock outcrops within Willapa Bay. The zone of no appreciable net shore-drift extends northward to slightly south of Smoky Hollow on the west side of the island.
