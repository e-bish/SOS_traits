Point Roberts quad

This drift cell runs northward along the eastern coast of Point Roberts
from Lilly Point to the Canadian border.

Net shore drift is to the northeast and north.

The beach at southernmost Lilly Point is mainly an erosional platform,
with a thin veneer of cobbles over clay.  High, vertical, unvegetated
cliffs of glacial drift and sand, which appear to be part of a series
of huge slump blocks, back the beach.  A backshore is not evident.  To
the northeast, the bluffs become less steep and more vegetated, as
they are protected by a low, flat cuspate landform, which widens and
bulges northward.  At the northern end of this cuspate accumulation
landform, sediment can be found accumulating on the southern side of
some water-logged logs.  Somewhat further north of this, a large
eroding cliff of sand is found.  The beach sediment, from this point
northward, contains distinctly more sand.  The beach broadens
northward into a long slim accretionary landform, once the site of an
Indian village, as indicated by a US Coast and Geodetic Survey maps
dating back to 1909.  The water between the spit and the mainland has
been filled in, in recent years, so that it no longer exists as a
visible spit.  The greatest fetch is about 48 kilometers to the
southeast.
