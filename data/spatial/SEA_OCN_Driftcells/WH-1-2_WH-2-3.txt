Drayton Harbor: From the Canadian border to one-half kilometer north of Dakota Creek,
there is no appreciable shore drift.  The natural shore has been
destroyed with riprap.  Tidal mud flats, barnacle-covered rocks, and one
very small isolated patch of gravel and cobbles are exposed at low tide.
In fact, much of the southern and eastern sides of Drayton Harbor are
mud-flats with salt grass frequently growing on the beachless shore.
Where some beach sediment does exist, it is in a strip a couple of meters
wide, with insignificant drift.  There is a noticeable accumulation of
gravel on the north side of the mouth of California Creek.  The gravel
apparently was drifted a short distance into the creek mouth.
