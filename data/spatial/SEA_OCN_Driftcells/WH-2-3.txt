Birch Point Quad

This drift cell extends from immediately next to the intersection of 
Shintaffer Road and Drayton Road to the distal end of Semiahmoo Spit.

Net shore drift is first to the northwest and then to the north-east,
respectively.

For the first two kilometers, the shore is sporadically defended,
mostly with riprap.  There is a repeated fining of the sediment to the
northwest near the basal end of Semiahmoo Spit, where some sediment
has accumulated on the southeast edge of an old shore defense
structure made of cement in bags.  Beach sediment grades from gravel
at the southwest end of the spit to sand at the northeast end.  The
beach widens in this direction. A bar is built out to the east of
Semiahmoo Spit.
