Birch Point Quad

This drift cell stretches northeast from Birch Point to Semiahmoo Spit for
a distance of approximately 6.5 kilometers.

The net drift in this cell is to the northeast throughout the entire
sector.

At Birch Point, the bluffs appear to be undergoing rapid erosion as
evidenced by unvegetated, unstable slopes.  These bluffs generally
become more vegetated to the northeast until the proximal end of
Semiahmoo Spit is reached.  Semiahmoo Spit is built in a northeast
direction.  Beach sediment grades from large cobbles at Birch Point to
sand at the distal end of Semiahmoo Spit.  At low tide, sand bars that
angle away from shore to the northeast can be seen.  At the middle of
this cell, home owners have built groins of concrete and of boulders
across the upper foreshore.  The groin furthest to the southwest appears
to have had the greatest effect.  Cobbles and gravel were piled up to a
depth of approximately one meter on the south-west side, while to the
northeast the width of the upper foreshore, composed mainly of cobbles
and some coarse gravel, was noticeably narrowed by erosion.

It is likely that the prevailing and predominant winds from the south
cause the sediment to move towards the northeast.

Greatest fetch is 40 kilometers to the west.
