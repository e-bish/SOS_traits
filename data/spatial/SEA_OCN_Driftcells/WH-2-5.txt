Birch Point Quad

This drift cell stretches from Birch Point to the Birch Bay Village
Marina.

Drift is to the southeast.

Coastal bluffs become more vegetated to the southeast.  Beach sediment
grades from cobbles at Birch Point to sand at the marina.  Sediment is
accumulating on the northwest side of the marine jetty and eroding on
the southeast side.  The dredged marina channel and jetty appear to be
an absolute barrier to the movement of drift.  Predominant waves from
the west strike the coast in the area in such a manner so as to move
sediment down the coast in a southeast direction.

Greatest fetch is to the west 40 kilometers.
