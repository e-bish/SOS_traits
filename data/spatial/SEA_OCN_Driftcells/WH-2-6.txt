Birch Point Quad

This drift cell is located from Birch Bay Village Marina to the most
northerly part of Birch Bay.

Net shore drift is to the northeast.

Sediment grades finer from the marina to the northeast.  The marina
jetty shows accumulation on its southwest side and erosion on its
northeast side.  The erosion is now endangering several homes.  This
entire cell is an accumulation beach formed by a series of nested
spits.  These were built by waves generated by predominate northwest
winds blowing across the 145 kilometer fetch along the Strait of
Georgia, which refract around Birch Point and the unnamed protuberance
of the coast at the marina site, and continue into Birch Bay.  Although
these nested spits have been somewhat obscured by recent construction,
they are still vaguely visible as a series of low, parallel ridges.  At
the most northerly corner of Birch Bay, at the end of this cell, a
northeasterly prograding lobe of sediment nearly closes a small
lagoon.

This drift cell and the adjacent cell to the north comprised one cell 
prior to the construction of the marina. At the present time there is 
no evidence of material drifting past the marina jetty.
