Blaine, Birch Point Quads

The coastline of this drift cell runs from the most northerly part of Birch
Bay in an arc to Point Whitehorn.

The drift proceeds from Point Whitehorn to the northeast and follows
the curve of Birch Bay in a northerly, counterclockwise direction up to
the northern most part of Birch Bay.

Birch Bay is a log-spiral beach opening to the south. It once had an even
more perfect log-spiral shape before the nested spits, described in the
preceding drift cell, were formed.  At Point Whitehorn, there is an
erosional platform and eroding bluffs.  This grades into accumulation
beaches to the northeast. Sediment grades from coarse cobbles at Point
Whitehorn to sand and silt at the end of the drift cell. Numerous
groins have been built along Birch Bay.  All show accumulation on their
southern sides and erosion on their northern sides.  Some groins are
falling over towards the north. The mouth of Terrell Creek has been
diverted nearly 3.2 kilometers to the north by the net shore drift.  The
refraction of waves, generated by the northwest winds coming down the
Strait of Georgia, is most likely responsible for this drift direction.
