Lummi Bay quad

This cell runs from Cove Creek to the northwestern end of the Red and
Lummi rivers shore defense dikes.

The net shore drift is to the northwest to Cove Creek from the headland
near the center of the cell.  From this same headland, drift is to the
northeast to the northwest end of the piling dike that extends across
the coastal flood plain of the Red and Lummi Rivers.

The eroding headland bluffs grade to well-vegetated slopes both to the
west and east.  West of the headland, a lobe of gravel and cobbles can
be seen built to the northwest.  Sediment size decreases to the
northwest, beach width increases to the northwest, and the mouth of
Cove Creek is diverted to the west by mostly gravel sediment that seems
to overlie finer sediment coming from the previous drift cell.  To the
east of the headland, sediment grades finer to the northeast, and the
beach broadens considerably to the northeast.

Sediment transport in this area is dominated by the 10 kilometer fetch
to the south and, to a lesser extent perhaps, by waves refracting around
Sandy Point.
