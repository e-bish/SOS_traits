Lummi Bay Quad

Northeast Lummi Bay: From the Red River south to the south end of the Lummi Aquaculture
dike there is no net shore drift.  A piling dike has been placed across
the mouth of the Red and Lummi Rivers.  Only some mudflats are visible
seaward of this shore defense.  The riprap Lummi Aquaculture dike
precludes any shore drift for the remainder of the sector.
