Lummi Bay Quad

This cell runs from the south side of the Sandy Point marina entrance
channel, around the southern end of the spit and along the eastern
coast of the spit to the mouth of Cove Creek.

The net shore drift is east around the southern end of Sandy Point. The
direction of net drift then changes with the shape of the coast so that
it moves northward in the remainder of the cell.

Several groins on the south end of Sandy Point, built in a futile
attempt to control erosion, all show marked erosion on the east and
accumulation on the west.  Aerial photographs taken before the marina
was built clearly show that the south and east coasts of Sandy Point
Spit were affected by sediment sweeping to the east and north,
respectively.  This is shown by low curving ridges aligned in these
directions.  Refraction of waves generated by predominant northwest
winds blowing down the large fetch of the Strait of Georgia would be
expected to cause this type of movement.  To a lesser extent, so would
southerly winds blowing across the limited fetch of Lummi Bay.

The greatest fetch for the southern coast of Sandy Point Spit is 12
kilometers to the southeast, but refraction of waves from the northwest
appears to be more important in this case.
