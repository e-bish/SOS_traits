Lummi Bay Quad

This cell stretches from the south wall of the Lummi Aquaculture
dike to a point about 1.6 kilometers northeast of Gooseberry Point.

Net shore drift direction is to the northeast.

The bluffs along this cell's coast gradually change from unvegetated,
eroding, steep slopes in the southwest to well-vegetated, more gradual
slopes in the northeast.  The beach broadens northeastward.  Beach
sediment grades from cobbles in the southwest to sand and gravel in
the northeast. On the coast immediately west of the intersection of
Robertson Road and Boynton Road, a beach is undergoing active accretion
and a small spit is building northeastward.  Further to the northeast,
where a creek reaches the coast just south of the south end of the
Lummi Aquaculture dike, a small spit is building north across the creek
mouth.  Sandy Point acts to screen out waves, produced by the
predominant northwest winds blowing down the Strait of Georgia, so they
do not hit this cell directly.  Most probably, waves refracting
around Sandy Point from the northwest and winds moving across the much
shorter 16 kilometer fetch to the west are responsible for the drift
direction in this cell.
