Lummi Island Quad

This drift cell starts at a slight protuberance of the coast a little over
1.6 kilometers northeast of Gooseberry Point and runs to the apex of
Gooseberry Point.

Net shore drift is to the southwest in this cell.

The beach widens to the southwest, and beach sediment grades
from cobbles in the northeast to sand in the southwest.  Coastal
bluffs, some of which have seawalls built in front of them by
landowners, become more vegetated to the southwest for 1.2 kilometers,
while Gooseberry Point itself is an accretion landform, indicating the
end of a drift cell.  Gooseberry Point is best described as a cuspate
spit.
