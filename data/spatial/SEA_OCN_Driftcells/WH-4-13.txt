Lummi Island Quad

This drift cell includes the coast from just north of the Portage (a
tombolo that connects Portage Island with the Lummi Peninsula) to the
apex of Gooseberry Point.

Net shore drift is to the north.

The beach broadens to the north. The coarsest fraction of sediment
grades from boulders and cobbles just north of the Portage to sand on
the west side of Gooseberry Point.  It was observed that near the
Lummi Stommish grounds, where a cement boat ramp has been built, the
sediment to the north of the boat ramp was noticeably finer than that
to the south of it.  Evidently, at times the boat ramp serves as a
selective barrier which allows the finer sediment to pass while
retaining coarser sediment.  This effect disappears during the action
of heavy storm waves, however.  Also, temporary sediment accumulations
have been observed on the south side of rocks and large cement blocks
just north of the Portage.

This northerly drift seems controlled by predominant southeast winds
blowing across the 10 kilometer fetch in Hale Pass.
