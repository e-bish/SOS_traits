Eliza Island, Lummi Island quads

This drift cell runs from the northeastern tip of Portage Island along the
western side of the Brant Point soit to its distal end.

Net shore drift is to the northwest in this sector.

The Brant Point spit is built to the northwest.  Sediment grades from
cobbles at the southwest to fine gravel at the northwest.  The spit
forms nearly a right angle with Portage Island and is wider at its
northwestern end. If the net shore drift was to the southeast, one
would expect that the junction of the spit with Portage Island would
be more gradual, and that the spit would be wider to the southeast
because of the accumulation of sediment there.
