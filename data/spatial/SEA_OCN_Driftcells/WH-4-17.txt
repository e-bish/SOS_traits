Eliza Island, Lummi Island quads

This drift cell stretches from just west and south of where Brant Point
connects to Portage Island and continues along the northern
crescent-shaped coast of Portage Island towards the west, about
two-thirds of the distance to the Portage.

Net shore drift is to the southwest, then northwest.

Erosion is occurring at the eastern end of the cell, as evidenced
by small, vertical, unvegetated scarps behind the beach, while the
western part of the sector is composed of two accumulation beaches,
separated only by a short section of low eroding bluff.  The most
easterly accumulation beach has diverted a stream sharply to the west,
while the more westerly beach appears to widen towards the west.
Sediment particle size fines from Brant Point west, with the exception
of the small vertical bluff which separates the two accumulation
beaches, where there is an addition of more sediment.
