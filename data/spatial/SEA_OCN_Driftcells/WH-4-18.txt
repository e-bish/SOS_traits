Lummi Island quad

This drift cell runs from the most westerly accumulation beach in the
preceding sector to the area where the Portage connects with Portage
Island.

Net shore drift is to the west in this cell.

For the most eastern part of this sector, there is little, if any,
evidence of drift.  Grass grows at the shore and cobbles covered with
barnacles lie in mud.  A small wave-cut scarp, which is about half a
meter high, is visible behind the beach.  The western end of this
sector exhibits a fining of sediment size to the west, indicating that
at least a small amount of drift is occurring there.
