Lummi Island Quad

This drift cell runs from the Portage northeastward over 0.8 kilometers
along the eastern side of the Lummi Peninsula to a point where the
shore is riprapped in an attempt to protect Lummi Shore Road.

Net shore drift is southwesterly.

The sediment grades from gravel at the northeast to sand at the
southwest.  The beach widens to the southwest.  This stretch of
coast is protected from the south, southeast, and east by Portage
Island, the Portage, and Brant Point.  The greatest fetch is 5
kilometers to the northeast.
