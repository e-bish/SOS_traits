Lummi Island, Eliza Island, Ferndale Quads

This drift cell begins 1.5 kilometers northeast of the Portage on the
eastern coast of Lummi Peninsula, at the northern end of the riprapped
coast in the adjacent cell to the south, and continues northeast to Fish
Point, near the Nooksack Delta.

Net shore drift is to the northeast.

The size of the coarsest beach sediment grades finer and the beach
widens to the northeast for approximately 1.6 kilometers.  At this
point, the high bluffs backing the lower foreshore are undergoing rapid
erosion.  The Whatcom County Road Department has been dumping dirt and
debris over the bluff here in an attempt to save Lummi Shore Road,
which runs along the top of the bluff.  Unfortunately, this mostly
fine-grained material is quickly washed away.  The beach widens again
to the northeast for 1.6 kilometers, where there is what appears to be
an old concrete boat ramp.  There is sediment accumulation on the
southwest side of the ramp. Along the stretch from the ramp
to Fish Point, the bluffs become less steep and more vegetated; repeated
cycles of beach sediment become finer and the beach widens.  Concrete is
found drifting northeastward from identifiable sources.  The greatest
fetch runs for 21 kilometers to the southeast.  It should be noted that
this entire cell is sporadically riprapped with diverse types of
material.
