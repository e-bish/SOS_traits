Eliza Island quad

This drift cell comprises the southwest corner of Eliza Island.

Net shore drift is to the northwest.

Beach sediment grades from coarse to fine particles toward the
northwest. The beach widens toward the northwest.  The southeast end
of this cell is composed of an eroding headland, while sediment is
accumulating on a beach in the northwestern part.  In fact, the water
depth, as shown by sonar, is 30 meters just offshore from the southeast
headland, while to the northwest, water depth of 10 meters exist about
100 meters from shore.  The greatest fetches are 10 kilometers each to
the south and southwest, while the prevailing, and most likely
predominant, winds are from the south and southwest.
