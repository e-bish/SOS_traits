Eliza Island quad

This drift cell consists of the northwest coast of Eliza Island.

Net shore drift is to the southwest.

Beach sediment grades finer to the southwest.  The northern part of
the cell is an eroding bluff, which becomes more vegetated to the
southwest, while the southwestern part is an accumulation beach.
The beach widens to the southwest.  The greatest fetches are to the
north and northwest, 11 kilometers each.  At 75-100 meters off the
shore, depth at the southwestern end is 5-10 meters, while at the
same distance offshore to the north, the depth is over 20 meters.
