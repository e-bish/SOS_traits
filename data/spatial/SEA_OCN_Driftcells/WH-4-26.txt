Lummi Island Quad

This  drift cell runs from the north end of Sunrise Cove
up the east coast of Lummi Island about 2.5 kilometers.

Net shore drift direction is to the northwest.

Just north of the cove, a small groin has been constructed of boulders.
There is noticeable accumulation on the south and erosion to the north
of the groin.  In fact, the beach to the south of the groin is raised
about a meter.  The bluff behind the beach on the south is uneroded,
while on the north, the bluff is being actively eroded. Another
similar groin with erosion on the north and accumulation on the south
is found further to the northwest.  For the next 1.6 kilometers north,
sediment can be seen accumulating, at times, on the south side of
boulders and other obstructions. An accumulation beach is also evident.
This cell grades from cobbles in the southeast to sand in the
northwest.  The greatest fetch is a distance of 19 kilometers to the
southeast.
