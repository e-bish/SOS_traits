Lummi Island Quad

East Lummi Island: From Carter Point, along the east coast of Lummi Island, north to
Sunrise Cove, there is no appreciable shore drift.  The area is
composed of eroding rock cliffs and a few isolated pocket beaches.

West Lummi Island: From Carter Point along the west coast of Lummi Island to a place
just opposite and a little south of Lummi Rocks, there is no
appreciable shore drift.  The coast in this area is mostly composed
of boulders which have fallen from the steep southwestern slope of
Lummi Island, eroding rock cliffs, and a few small pocket beaches.
