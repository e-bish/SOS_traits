Lummi Island Quad

This drift cell runs north from a headland at the indentation in the east
coast of Lummi Island directly east of Legoe Bay to a new ferry
terminal on Lummi Island.

Net shore drift is to the northwest.

Sediment has accumulated on the south side of the ferry terminal, which
forms a barrier to net shore drift. The greatest fetch is to the
southeast.
