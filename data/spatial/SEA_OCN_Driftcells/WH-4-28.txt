Lummi Island Quad

This drift cell starts in the eroding bluffs north of the Lummi Island
ferry terminal and continues to the apex of Lummi Point.

Net shore drift is to the northwest and north.

Sediment grades finer north, from cobbles and gravel to gravel.
Sediment is accumulated on the south side of a very low, crude, rock
groin about half a kilometer south of the apex of Lummi Point.
Eroding sandstone bluffs grade northward into an accretionary beach.
The greatest fetch is to the southeast with a distance of 10 kilometers.
