Lummi Island Quad

This drift cell runs from eroding rock bluffs north of Lummi Point to the
apex of Lummi Point.

Net shore drift is to the southeast.

The beach sediment grades from mixed sand and gravel in the north to
sand at the distal end of Lummi Point.  The shore is composed of
eroding bluffs to the north and an accretionary beach to the south.
The beach widens to the south.  Eroding sandstone bluffs run from the
northern end of this cell to Point Migley.  The greatest fetch is 42
kilometers to the northwest.
