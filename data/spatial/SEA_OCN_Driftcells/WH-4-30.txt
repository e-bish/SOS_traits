Lummi Island Quad

This drift cell stretches from a point on the west coast of Lummi
Island, just south of Lummi Rocks, to the northwest, approximately 2.5
kilometers, to a headland where the flat northern portion of the island
meets the mountainous southern half.  It should be noted that this
cell is composed of several beaches separated by headlands.  While
there is probably some sediment drifting around some of the headlands,
at most there may not be, due to the great depth of water.  Since the
net shore drift on these beaches was all in the same direction, and it
was not feasible to determine if the headlands create a total barrier
to shore drift, these beaches have been grouped together in one cell
for ease of presentation.

Net shore drift is to the northwest.

There are repeated sequences of fining beach sediment to the north,
grading from cobble to gravel.  There are also several instances of
slight accretionary beaches forming on the south side of the
headlands.  The greatest fetches are 15 kilometers to the southwest
and 13 kilometers to the southeast.  Much of this part of Lummi Island
is sheltered from  the northwest fetch of the Strait of Georgia by the
northern part of the island.
