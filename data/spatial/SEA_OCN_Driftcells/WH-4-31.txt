Lummi Island Quad

This drift cell runs from the northern boundary of WH-4-30 northward
along the west coast of Lummi Island to Legoe Bay.

Net shore drift is to the northwest.

Bluffs behind the beach become less steep, more stable, and more
heavily vegetated to the northwest.  The beach sediment fines to the
northwest from cobbles to gravel. The beach widens to the northwest.
A boat ramp about 0.8 kilometers from the southern boundary of this
cell has sediment accumulated to the south of it.  Another longer
boat ramp, located halfway through this cell, has sediment
accumulation on its south side and erosion on its north side.  The
beach in the northern part of this cell has prograded seaward at
the headland at Lover's Bluff, as would be expected with a
northwesterly drift.  The greatest fetchs are to the southwest and
southeast with a distance each of 15 kilometers.
