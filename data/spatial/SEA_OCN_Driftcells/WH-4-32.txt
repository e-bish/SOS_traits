Lummi Island Quad

This drift cell runs from Lover's Bluff, the headland at southern-most
Legoe Bay, to the apex of Village Point.

Net shore drift is to the west.

The shoreward offset in the Legoe Bay beach from the northernmost
beach in the drift cell to the south indicates westward drift.  If 
the drift was to the east, this offset would be reversed or non-existent.  
Large blocks and cobbles of green breccia, eroded from the headland at
southernmost Legoe Bay, are found along the beach after drifting
northwest.  Sediment accumulation on the southeast side of a concrete
boat ramp behind the Lummi School of Aquaculture is apparent.
Erosion is evident on the northwest side.  Sediment accumulation
exists on the east side of a short riprap jetty-like structure about
0.8 kilometers to the northwest.  Beach sediment grades from large
cobbles at the southern end of this cell to pea-sized gravel just
west of the Village Point Marina dock.  At this point, the shore
protrudes seaward and is composed of cobbles.  This anomaly may
possibly be the first sign of sediment starvation caused by the short
jetty and the Village Point Marina dock partially blocking net shore
drift.  The beach sediment then grades from cobbles to gravel in the
west, to the apex of Village Point, which is an accumulation landform.
The backshore widens to the west in Legoe Bay.  Greatest fetches are
21 kilometers to the southwest and 16 kilometers to the southeast.
