City of Bellingham and South Bellingham: From the southeast end of 
Drift Cell WH-5-22 to the Fairhaven Marine Park, the shore has become

From the Fairhaven Marine Park to the southern boundary of Whatcom
County, the coast is comprised of riprap placed along a railroad line,
rocky cliffs, and several pocket beaches. Pocket beaches include those
found at Chuckanut Bay, Pleasant Bay, and Wildcat Cove. No significant
shore drift occurs along this stretch.
