Waldron Island quad

This 0.5 km drift cell originates near the eastern prominence of Point Hammond, which is near the northern tip of the island, at an eroding, poorly-vegetated bluff cut into glacial outwash.  Net sediment movement from this zone of drift divergence is to the north along a predominantly gravel beach, and is deposited in the small tombolo at Point Hammond.  Evidence of northward net shore-drift is the northward increase in beach width and sediment fining.  Excess sediment is lost to deeper water beyond the point to the north.
