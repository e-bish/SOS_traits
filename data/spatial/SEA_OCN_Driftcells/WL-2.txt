Waldron Island quad

This 1.7-km-drift cell begins at a zone of drift divergence in front of the eastern prominence of Point Hammond.  This near-vertical, eroding bluff cut into glacial outwash is the sediment source for this cell.  Net shore-drift is to the south, beginning along a boulder beach at the base of the bluff, which grades into sand along the middle of the beach sector, before becoming predominantly gravel at the southern end of the beach.  A pronounced beach ridge, with abundant driftwood, is piled up against the rock outcrop that defines the southern end of the beach, indicating southward net shore-drift. Hence, a reverse gradation is present in the predominant sediment size (in comparison to the expected sediment size decrease in the direction of net shore-drift) alongshore on the southern portion of this beach.
