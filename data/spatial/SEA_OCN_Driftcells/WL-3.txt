Waldron Island quad

This 4.1-km-long drift cell originates in the eroding cliff on the west side of Point Disney, at the southern end of Waldron Island.  The western side of the point is a near-vertical 120-m-high cliff, the lower 90 m of which is conglomerate fronted by talus, the first source of drift material in this cell.  Net shore-drift is to the north as indicated by three large accumulations of beach gravel on the south sides of rock formations interrupting drift in front of the town of Waldron, decreasing sediment size and generally increasing beach width to the north.  The second, and primary, source of sediment are the eroding bluffs composed of glacial outwash north and west of the town of Waldron. Lag deposits consisting of large boulders are present in the nearshore zone here.  Continuing westward, there is a low-lying accretional sector of shore, with progressively increasing beach width, indicative of westward net shore-drift.  The terminus of the drift cell is at the south side of Sandy Point, a cuspate spit, which is also indicative of westward net shore-drift.
