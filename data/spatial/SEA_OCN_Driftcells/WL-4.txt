Waldron Island quad

This 5.8-km-long drift cell begins immediately west of Point Hammond at a near-vertical, eroding bluff composed of glacial drift that contains a high percentage of sand.  The bluff is fronted by a narrow, boulder and cobble beach.  Net shore-drift is to the west, continuing around a gentle bend in the shore to an accretionary beach.  Indicators here include several sandstone outcrops that serve as obstacles, consistently collecting material on the eastern side, decreasing sediment size, and increasing beach width to the southwest.  Net shore-drift continues to the west and southwest around Fishery Point, where sandstone outcrops do not extend below MLLW, leaving a continuous band of sediment.  Southwest of Fishery Point in North Bay, sand is accumulating in the nearshore zone.  Water depths are currently considerably shallower than indicated on the 1954 quadrangle (USGS, 1954).  This area also has an accreting beach.  Further to the southwest, a sandy bluff is partially exposed behind the beach, which is still in the process of straightening out.  Just east of Sandy Point the beach is at its greatest width for this drift cell (and for the island); the average distance from the late summer berm crest to the toe of the bluff is approximately 8 m, indicating southwestward net shore-drift.  The drift cell terminus is found at Sandy Point, a narrow cuspate spit, extending southwestward from a headland comprised of glacial outwash.
