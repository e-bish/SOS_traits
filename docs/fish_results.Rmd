This page will contain preliminary analyses for fish data.

## Fish trait PCoAs

The functional trait space using various axes:

```{r PCoA1, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here("docs", "figures", "fish_funct.space.plot.png"))
```

PCoA by species:

```{r PCoA2, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here("docs", "figures", "fish_pcoa.png"))
```

This version has been constructed with the mFD package with a quality of functional space metric of 0.072 for 3 axes. 

This plot shows what traits are influencing which axes (where blue are more significant)
```{r trait_axes, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here("docs", "figures", "fish_trait_axes_plot.png"))
```

## Fish functional diversity indices across sites

```{r FD_sites, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here("docs", "figures", "fish_FDpatch.png"))
```
Some interesting between-site differences, mostly with Cornet Bay.

## Fish functional diversity indices across regions
```{r FD_region, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here("docs", "figures", "fish_FDregionalpatch.png"))
```

## Fish functional diversity indices across shoreline types
```{r FD_ipa, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here("docs", "figures", "fish_FDipapatch.png"))
```
